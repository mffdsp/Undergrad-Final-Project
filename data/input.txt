The CIA investigation of Wikileaks announced recently by Director Leon Panetta is likely based on cables of the CIA and State Department global communications systems which transmit cables like those allegedly lifted by Bradley Manning and perhaps given to Wikileaks, although Wikileaks has denied having them. The Wikileaks "insurance.aes256" file might contain CIA files, or joint CIA-State, describing black ops and worse, far more lethal than any other leaks to US reputation. If that file has been cracked by the USG it would activate the CIA investigation. CIA runs its own crypto rooms at embassies, consulates and stations with access forbidden to State employees -- back-channel directed operations bypass State, which is considered leaky by the CIA. CIA provides some crypto services to supplement State's crypto teams. There is probably concern that the allegedly leaked cables might have compromised the CIA system. The State Department's warning to not use AES encryption for classified radio transmittals raises the question of what encryption is used for classified global communications and the alleged leaked cables. Wikileaks has claimed to have cracked the gun Iraq ship video encryption. Whether the cables, if encrypted -- and many cables are sent in the clear on classified systems -- can be cracked by whoever may have them is surely a prime goal of the CIA's investigation. Communications stations are shared worldwide by the two agencies; in the US two main stations are located at Site D, Warrenton, VA, and SA-26, Beltsville, MD, where contractors perform much of the work -- a sample resume: http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomcraw4d Department Manager

He is considered one of the best Russians ever in each of those sports.[1]

Originally a football player, he played for CDKA Moscow, VVS Moscow, and Spartak Moscow, and represented the Soviet Union internationally at the 1952 Summer Olympics. After he quit football in 1953 he turned to ice hockey, which he had taken up when it was started in the Soviet Union in 1946. He was one of the first ice hockey players in the Soviet Union, and joined CDKA Moscow, playing for them and VVS Moscow before retiring in 1957. A leading scorer in the Soviet League, Bobrov was one of three players to average more than two goals per game over their career, with the other two players (Alexei Guryshev and Viktor Shuvalov) his linemates. Internationally he participated with the Soviet national team at several World Championships, including their first tournament in 1954, as well as the 1956 Winter Olympics, where the Soviets won the gold medal.

After his playing career, Bobrov coached both football and ice hockey. He coached the Soviet national team in ice hockey, most notably during the 1972 Summit Series against Canada. A renowned athlete, he was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1997. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), a Russian-based league, has one of its four divisions named after Bobrov.

Biograph

Early life

Bobrov Russian commemorative coin celebrating

Bobrov was born in Morshansk on 1 December 1922 and moved to Sestroretsk in 1925, along with his parents and two siblings.[2] He first started to skate at the age of 5, and played bandy from a young age. He left school when he was 13 in order to work in a factory.[3]

Playing career

After serving in the Soviet Army during World War II, he was invited to play football for the Army club CSKA Moscow in 1945. That same year, he joined Dynamo Moscow on their 1945 tour of the United Kingdom; he scored 6 of the 19 their goals, and it was on this tour that he saw artificial ice for the first time.[4] Playing until 1953 for CSKA, VVS, and Spartak, he would go on to win the Soviet Championship three times, scoring 97 goals in only 116 games. Bobrov led the country in goals in 1945 with 24 and 1947 with 14. Chronic knee problems led to him having surgeries in 1947, 1950, 1952, and 1953, to fix the issue, though it never was resolved.[5]

He was capped three times for the Soviet Union national team representing them in the 1952 Summer Olympics. He scored five goals in total, including a hat trick against Yugoslavia, though the Soviets lost that match and failed to medal. He was also part of the CDKA team that was disbanded due to this loss, and transferred to Spartak Moscow for his final season of football.[6]

Bobrov began playing hockey for CSKA a year after his football start, in 1946. However, due to a knee injury sustained during the football season, he missed the first season.[7] His playing career in this sport lasted until 1957, with the years between 1950 and 1953 spent with VVS. Although football was Bobrov's first sport, his success in ice hockey was even greater. In 1950, a plane crash almost killed the entire VVS Moscow team. Bobrov survived the crash as he overslept and travelled by rail. In the Soviet Championship, which his teams won seven times, Vsevolod scored 254 goals in only 130 games. He played for the Soviet national team in the 1956 Winter Olympics, becoming one of the few athletes to participate in both the Summer and Winter games. Bobrov proceeded to lead his country to the gold medal, and also won the World Championship in 1954 and 1956. Overall, he scored 89 goals in 59 games for his country. In Russian ice hockey, his name was given to an exclusive list of players, the Bobrov Club, who scored over 250 goals during their career.

Bobrov, who served as a player-coach in both sports during his time with VVS, would go on to coach various teams after retiring as a player in both football and ice hockey. In the latter, he coached the USSR in the 1972 Summit Series and then led them to the World Championship in 1974 and 1975.

Later life and legacy 

Vsevolod Bobrov died in Moscow in 1979. He was elected to the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 1997, the first year it was created. For the greatest Russian athlete in the 20th century, Bobrov finished third behind football goalkeeper Lev Yashin and Greco-Roman wrestler Alexander Karelin.

The Kontinental Hockey League, a Russian-based ice hockey league, has one of its four divisions named after Bobrov.[8]

Inception: Music from the Motion Picture is the soundtrack to the 2010 film of the same name directed by Christopher Nolan, released under Reprise Records on July 13, 2010. Hans Zimmer scored the film, marking his third collaboration with Nolan following Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.

Production

According to Zimmer, the soundtrack for Inception is "a very electronic score".[1] Nolan asked Zimmer to compose and finish the score as he was shooting the film. The composer said, "He wanted to unleash my imagination in the best possible way".[2] At one point, while composing the score, Zimmer incorporated a guitar sound reminiscent of Ennio Morricone and was interested in having Johnny Marr, former guitarist in the influential 80s rock band The Smiths, play these parts. Zimmer's reported inspiration was finding a synthesizer track which he had written similar to Marr's guitar style. Nolan agreed with Zimmer's suggestion, and then Zimmer approached Marr, who accepted his offer. Marr spent four 12-hour days working on the score, playing notes written by Zimmer with a 12-string guitar.[3][4]

For inspiration, Zimmer read Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter because it combined "the idea of playfulness in mathematics and playfulness in music".[2] Zimmer did not assemble a temp score but "every now and then they would call and say 'we need a little something here.' But that was OK because much of the music pieces aren't that scene specific. They fall into little categories".[2] While writing the screenplay, Nolan wrote in Édith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" but almost took it out when he cast Marion Cotillard, who had just completed an Oscar-winning turn as Piaf in the 2007 film La Vie en rose. Zimmer convinced Nolan to keep it in the film and also integrated elements of the song into his score;[3] in particular, the film's iconic brass instrument fanfare resembles a slowed-down version of the song's instrumentation.

The trailers for the film feature specially composed music by Zack Hemsey, which does not appear on the official soundtrack.[5] The soundtrack was nominated for several awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Grammy and a BAFTA.

Critical reception

The score received mostly positive reception. Regarding Zimmer's previous collaborations with Nolan, Archie Watt of MovieCues said "it's very obvious to anybody who has heard his previous scores for the director that this score is built firmly on their foundations. The compositions are very simple ones, but here the familiar elements of those previous scores are pulled off in a more energetic and complex way. That’s what puts this score a good distance ahead of them". Whilst praising several elements of the score, his review was largely negative, saying "Despite the fact that certain music on this album is inarguably good, the majority of it is rather dull and mundane".

More enthusiastic were James Southall of Movie Wave, who awarded the score five stars, calling it "Zimmer’s finest work in a number of years", and Jim Lochner of Film Score Click Track, who said "Inception is one thrilling and trippy musical ride", awarding the score four and a half stars out of five.

Since then Holkenborg has made several other collaborations with Hans Zimmer, like the production of scores for Madagascar 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.[11]                                                                                                                                                                      0000103-8b6b9fbdf0d51d90aec35451bdc3b4a8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003026 00000000000 015361  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        While hard rock and metal bands were snubbed in most of the categories for the 2013 Grammy Awards that were announced tonight (Dec. 5), the one category devoted to those genres features a diverse range of nominees.

The Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance category boasts nominations for Anthrax , Halestorm , Iron Maiden , Lamb of God , Marilyn Manson and Megadeth . Of all those acts, only Iron Maiden has previously won a Grammy.

Anthrax are nominated for 'I'm Alive' off their album 'Worship Music,' while Halestorm got a nod for 'Love Bites (So Do I)' from their full-length effort 'The Strange Case Of ...' Meanwhile, Iron Maiden scored a mention for 'Blood Brothers' from their 'En Vivo' CD/DVD and Lamb of God got a nod for 'Ghost Walking' from their 'Resolution' album. Finally, Marilyn Manson earned a nomination for 'No Reflection' off 'Born Villain,' while Megadeth scored a mention for 'Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)' from their album 'TH1RT3EN.'

Congrats to all of those acts for representing hard rock and metal at the upcoming 55th annual Grammy Awards taking place on Feb. 10, 2013 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The event will air live on CBS at 8PM ET.

In other rock categories, the Black Keys and Jack White led the way with multiple nominations. See all the rock nominees here .

Just another week in the drug war. Let's get to it:

In Montgomery, Alabama, a Wilcox County deputy sheriff pleaded not guilty last Tuesday to charges he transported packages of what he thought was cocaine from Montgomery to Camden. Deputy Greg Barge, 45, was arrested in late June and has been held in custody ever since. He is accused of taking $800 in one incident and $1,200 in another to deliver the "drugs" while in uniform and carrying his police-issue weapon. He is charged with drug possession with intent to distribute and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime.

In West Chester, Pennsylvania, a Chester County Prison guard was arrested last Thursday on charges he routinely smuggled drugs and other contraband into the jail. Erik Messner, 24, went down after a confidential informant snitched him out. According to authorities, inmates would arrange with family members to meet Messner, then give him drugs, tobacco, and cash to smuggle into the jail. Messner would keep a portion of the cash and drugs and deliver the rest to inmates. He is charged with various conspiracy and drug offenses and, at last report, was residing at his former workplace.

In Reynolds, Georgia, a Reynolds police officer was arrested last Friday on charges he accessed confidential law enforcement information and passed it on to a drug dealer. Officer Terrell Gibson went down in a joint investigation by the DEA, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the sheriff's office. He was released on bond late Friday evening, but is now former Officer Gibson, having been fired that same day.

In Washington, DC, a former Metro DC police officer pleaded guilty last Thursday to charges he aided and abetted a cocaine dealer's efforts to launder drug money. Jared Weinberg, 28, rented an apartment from the cocaine dealer which the dealer sometimes used to make coke deals. Weinberg also helped count drug money and admitted to laundering some $14,900. He pleaded guilty to money laundering and is looking at 10 to 16 months in federal prison when he is sentenced in December.

In Cincinnati, a former Hamilton County evidence room supervisor pleaded guilty Monday to stealing drugs and jewelry from the evidence room and was sentenced to six years in prison. Michael Esposito, 71, took methadone, oxycodone, phentermine, and marijuana, and had his wife and stepson sell them and share the profits. His wife is going away for four years. Esposito pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated trafficking, one count of trafficking in drugs, one count of drug theft, and one count of theft. The thefts all involved cases that had already been resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0000033-be9fbb5b0f20907410f2f78e7aad1f37.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004700 00000000000 015227  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Fourth Amendment generally requires the police to obtain a warrant before searching a home, though that requirement may be avoided if the homeowner consents to the search. But happens when two (or more) people reside in the same home, and only one of them consents to the search while the other refuses? Do the police have sufficient consent to conduct a warrentless search in that instance?

The Supreme Court addressed this question in the 2006 case of Georgia v. Randolph and came down against the police. At issue was a domestic violence investigation where the male suspect refused to let the police search his home while his wife welcomed the search. The police went in. Yet according to the Supreme Court, the man’s refusal should have stopped the cops in their tracks. “A physically present inhabitant’s express refusal of consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant,” the Court ruled.

Today, the Supreme Court returned to this subject with a new ruling in favor of law enforcement. At issue in Fernandez v. California was a 2009 search by the Los Angeles Police Department of the home of a robbery suspect. When the officers first arrived, suspect Walter Fernandez denied them entry, but because his girlfriend Roxanne Rojas exhibited signs of recent injury, Fernandez was arrested on separate charges of domestic violence. While Fernandez was being booked, one of the officers returned to the apartment and gained Rojas’ permission to conduct a search, which soon turned up evidence linking Fernandez to the robbery.

Writing for a 6-3 majority, Justice Samuel Alito upheld the LAPD’s actions. “A warrantless consent search is reasonable and thus consistent with the Fourth Amendment irrespective of the availability of a warrant,” Alito wrote. Moreover, he added, “Denying someone in Rojas’ position the right to allow the police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her independence.”

Writing in dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, accused the majority of weakening the Fourth Amendment and granting the police too much latitude. “Instead of adhering to the warrant requirement,” Ginsburg wrote, “today’s decision tells the police they may dodge it, nevermind ample time to secure the approval of a neutral magistrate.” This ruling, she charged, “shrinks to petite size our holding in Georgia v. Randolph.”                                                                0000107-6015d77bd3d1a2188394374c40f63b15.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014377 00000000000 014602  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Big battery phones used to be only for calling, thankfully Oukitel changed that and now we have K6000 Plus Review – Big Battery Flagship.

K6000 Plus Review – Design and Built Quality

The original K6000 and K6000 Pro were milestones in both built quality and performance in 2015.

As years go by the trends change and K6000 Plus changes with the modern times.



Oukitel has really outdone themselves in the front side. Looks are inspired by Huawei P10 and Lenovo P2 and you immediately feel how premium the phone is. K6000 Plus’s built quality even surpasses Redmi Note 4X in my opinion.

Display quality is really top-notch with vibrant colours and great visibility.



Handling the phone feels natural and easy. The Front Fingerprint scanner is accurate and effective, but cannot compare with flagship devices like Mi 6 and Huawei P10.

Best looking phone when it comes to display and built quality at this price.

Asahi Glass is not as popular as Gorilla Glass, but it’s even better! That’s right!

Crazy tough and scratch-resistant.



The back side is a bit plainer compared to the front with a nice grey metal shell and plastic top and bottom antennas.

Following current trends, K6000 Plus comes in Black/Silver and White/Gold options, and both look great.

K6000 Plus Review – Software

Running a very stock Android 7.0 most of you will feel right at home. Gone are the days of bloatware from smaller Chinese companies, K6000 Plus offers a very clean and user-friendly experience.

Customizations options are available from the start with 10-15 themes to choose from.



Oukitel’s latest flagship comes with all Google Apps and services pre-loaded and integrated.

Only additions here are the One Hand panel, which is really handy. Basically, it’s a toggle and recent apps in one and you can access it by swiping from the bottom right corner.

All Nougat features like Split-Screen Multitasking and Screen Recording run great.

Plenty of languages is built-in making for a great international usage.



The camera app is lacklustre and although a manual mode is present it’s not the full manual.

You can’t adjust exposure time or focus, just exposure, ISO and White Balance.

K6000 Plus Review – Performance

K6000 Pro comparison

General performance is very good, thanks to the 1.5GHz Octa-Core CPU and 4GB RAM. Side-loading all your apps is a breeze as the K6000 Plus rarely breaks a sweat.

K6000 Pro’s MT6753 is still quite capable, however, there is a clear difference in performance.

Opening lots of tabs and multi-tasking results to slow-downs and more heat from the CPU of the older K6000 Pro.

K6000 Plus Antutu

K6000 Pro Antutu

We see a nice boost in 3D performance, compared to the older MT6753.

I was disappointed not to find a Gyroscope and Magnetic sensor in the K6000 Plus as this was a much-requested feature in the K6000 Pro.

K6000 Plus Gaming

Most light and moderate 3D Games run great,

however, some heavier 3D(First Person Shooters) games will experience lag.



Considering K6000 Pro’s MT6753 can barely handle moderate 3D games now K6000 Plus is a real upgrade.

K6000 Plus Battery Life

Battery performance is superb in standby and GPS mode, if you use your phone mainly for browsing and media 12-14 Hrs of SoT are possible on a single charge.

Mainly for calls, social media and light browsing and youtube the K6000 Plus can a good 30% more compared to K6000 Pro.



Gaming hurts battery life more. You would still get around 6Hrs of SoT with heavy gaming involved, which by itself is not bad. Much better than the 3-4 Hrs with the K6000 Pro’s MT6753.

K6000 Plus LASTS WEEKS on a single charge mostly for calls and standby, a superb backup phone.

Furthermore, a Helio P20 or Snapdragon 625 would have given even better battery life here, although that would make the phone more expensive.

Charging takes around 2 Hrs thanks to the 24W Quick Charger.

Rest assured you can get a full day of moderate usage with just 30mins of charging.

K6000 Plus Camera Review

Both 6000 Pro and 6000 Plus feature 16MP Main cameras, but both use different vendors.

K6000 Pro relies on Sony IMX214, while K6000 Plus relies on 16MP OmniVision OV16880, same as the XIaomi Mi MIX, Mi MAX and LeEco S3!

Let’s check out some auto-shots from the K6000 Plus!



Omnivision’s 16MP sensor delivers great photos for the price, simple and effective with fast-autofocusing and plenty of details. Colours tend to be darker, and there is a bit of overexposure, however, given the price I think the cameras are outstanding.

That being said Video Quality is still behind Xiaomi and especially Meizu devices at this price.

The real difference is with the front cam as the new 8MP sensor is far better than the 5MP one present in the K6000 Pro.



K6000 Plus delivers much better selfies, compared to most phones in this price category.

With camera not being the main focus, Oukitel has managed to pack very capable sensors given the price.

K6000 Plus Pros and Cons

K6000 Plus Review Pros

+ Excellent built quality at this price point

+ Great Display

+ 4GB RAM and 64GB expandable storage!

+ Android 7.0 with no Bloatware

+ Great Battery Life and better charging times

+ Capable Cameras

K6000 Plus Review Cons

– Video Quality is sub-par

– Helio P20 or SD625 would have given much better battery life

– No Gyroscope or Magnetic Sensor

K6000 Plus Conclusion

I can definitely recommend K6000 Plus to anyone looking for a good phone in this price category.

Great display, built quality, general performance and outstanding battery backup along with capable cameras.

If you don’t have your heart set on a Gyroscope, Compass sensor and shooting lots of videos that is.

In a post today about Kellyanne Conway’s “Bowling Green massacre” lie, Bob Somerby asks an excellent question:

What have they done with the real Kevin Drum?

That’s easy: he died on November 8th. Continuing directly:

In his own furious, snark-heavy post, Drum asserts that Conway didn’t make an honest mistake in her error-strewn recitation. “Do not for a second think that this wasn’t deliberate,” Drum says. ….It’s plain that Conway made several misstatements on Hardball. Is it possible that her misstatements were made in some type of good faith? That she actually bungled the giant pile of index cards which are constantly fluttering around inside her grievance-fueled head? In our view, she may have known that she was misstating; it’s possible that she didn’t.

Somerby thinks we should be careful about using the word lie. I agree. Generally speaking, it’s always difficult to know if a falsehood is deliberate. That said, let’s review the evidence:

Contra Somerby, Conway is not some fluttery airhead. She is very smart and she knows exactly what she’s doing.

She had obviously prepped for her appearance on Hardball. The Bowling Green incident is not something she would have known about otherwise.

Here is Conway’s quote: “Two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green ______.” Watch the video. She didn’t stumble or search for words. She said “they were the masterminds behind….” The only type of word that fits at the end is massacre or incident or plot or something similar. Instead, she later claimed that she meant to say terrorists. That’s plainly nonsensical.

The idea that you’d accidentally use the word massacre in this context is laughable. That’s a million miles away from any normal description of what happened. However, it is very handy for scaring the hell out of people about the danger of Muslim refugees.

The Trump administration, and Conway in particular, have been spewing falsehoods at firehose volume ever since Election Day. (And before that, of course.) Surely there’s a point at which they forfeit the assumption of good faith? Lying is clearly a deliberate strategy on their part.

This is not 1999. Or 2000. Or 2008. Or even 2016. As the Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson said in a piece about Trump’s claim that 3-5 million illegal votes were cast last year—a piece that Somerby praised—”The voter fraud canard was just one in a rush of falsehoods that poured from Trump and his advisers during his first 10 days in office.” The Toronto Star counts 33 Trump falsehoods in his first 14 days. Even if you’re a little more forgiving than the Star, that’s a whole lot of falsehoods. And that’s just Trump. It doesn’t include Sean Spicer or Kellyanne Conway or anyone else in the White House. If you do include them, here is Politifact’s scorecard:

Kellyanne Conway doesn’t have the deep track record that her boss has amassed with Politifact, but what she lacks in quantity she’s making up for in quality. Of the statements of hers that Politifact has checked, not a single one was true. Not. A. Single. One.

So: did Conway lie about Bowling Green? I’d say the evidence is overwhelming that she did. Now, under normal circumstances maybe even overwhelming wouldn’t be quite enough. You’d need a smoking gun. But that standard doesn’t work for the Trump administration. They don’t just lie constantly, they repeat lies even after they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they’re lies. They lie to your face in the most insulting possible way, as Spicer did in his infamous performance on January 21 about the crowds at Trump’s inauguration. At some point, the falsehoods come so thick and fast that you have to conclude they’re deliberate.

We’ve easily reached that point. You simply can’t cover the Trump administration accurately unless you assume that most of their falsehoods are intentional. How much evidence do you need, after all? It’s a new era, folks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0000064-3657ae9d6950063d64ffe5d484ccbddc.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015302 00000000000 015255  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

It’s estimated that humans could survive for only four years if bees were to disappear from our planet.

Four years.

And at the current rate of wildlife extinction levels – estimated to be around 10,000 species a year – the possibility of a world minus our hard-working honey producers and pollinators is an ever-increasing possibility.

Urban bees, surprisingly, on the other hand, are doing rather well.

London, even more ironically, is the place to be… if you’re a bee.

‘In fact, London has a higher density of honey bees than anywhere else in the country’, says Tristam Sutton, apiary manager and beekeeping association trustee, speaking from Walworth Garden at Kennington, south London.

‘It’s a misconception that cities are bad for bees,’ he says. ‘Ironically, urban environments with parks and gardens provide a very good habitat for honeybees.

‘The difficulty in London is ensuring the forage areas are kept free from buildings to ensure the bees have areas to find food.

‘That includes the way in which open spaces are managed, and what types of flowers are planted.’

A very innovative beehive home has been created by James Reed, owner of the UK firm Reed Recruitment.

At his central London base at Covent Garden, he and his wife, Nicola, have installed a hive on the rooftop balcony – only metres away from James’s desk and within easy viewing of his hundreds of London staff.

‘When we first brought bees to the office, a few people looked concerned and a couple of people confessed they had a long-standing fear of bees,’ said James.

‘But things have improved as the bees have settled in. As long as the bees don’t swarm in through the office window one afternoon then we should be fine.

‘They’re very interesting to look at. You can sit and watch them going to work and it’s quite fascinating.’

‘It’s crucial that we encourage bees and look after them,’ said Nicola, an avid beekeeper who has guided her husband James through his rooftop bee installation.

‘They’re the only insect that provides food that we can eat and we benefit from.’

James is pleased to bring bees back to Covent Garden, to a place he says was once ‘full of flowers’.

‘Covent Garden is the site of the old Convent Garden that was once attached to Westminster Abbey,’ he says. ‘It seems entirely right that our bees should make it their home.’

The work ethic and hierarchy of bees are quite extraordinary, which makes it even more appropriate that a recruitment agency leader has become a bee champion.

The life of a bee The workers provide the most interesting career progression. They start working as soon as they hatch, fully formed. They start by producing wax, feeding other bees, feeding the Queen (she doesn’t feed herself), grooming, and also cleaning out the cells after new bees have been born. A lot of the work they do when they are younger revolves around housekeeping. Then, as they grow older, their roles evolve and they carry them out closer and closer to the entrance of the hive. A role collecting pollen and nectar from foragers and storing that in the cells for the colony to live off follows the housekeeping role. Then, close yet to the entrance, they will become guard bees. Finally, they end their career by becoming foragers. The new foragers fly off to get pollen then return to do their famous waggle dance, which communicates a message to the hive about food and its location outside.

So, bees are doing well in London.

However, the same happy bee scenario can not be seen in many parts of the UK and beyond.

Colony collapse – the dying of thousands of bees that typically make up one hive – has been reported across vast swathes of America and, to a lesser degree, parts of mainland Europe.

One of the leading causes of colony collapse is the use of pesticides. Farmers use potent chemical mixes, often containing neonicotinoids – nerve-agent chemicals that damage insects’ immune systems, making it harder for them to fight off fungal, parasitic, viral, and bacterial infections.

If the nervous system in bees is disrupted, it can cause problems foraging. Hives under environmental stress also respond by sending out their younger, inexperienced worker bees to forage for food, making them more likely to die prematurely.

Without foragers to bring pollen back to the hive, the colony cannot survive, leading to a loss of approximately 30,000 bees per hive.

This is devastating for many reasons. Not only is it losing us a complex piece of wildlife, which is fascinating once you understand the life cycle and culture of a hive, it also means – from an entirely selfish, human perspective (which, after all, motivates most of our practices and politics) – that we lose out on huge volumes of food.

Bees provide pollination for 70% of commercial crops across the world.

So – can you put a price on a bee?

Well, this is what the United Nations report did in 2010 when it claimed that bees are worth £134 billion.

Real value isn’t found in money, of course.

A healthy ecosystem is one in which things are balanced.

London is a landscape which can appear harsh for wildlife, yet it’s proved to be a safe harbour for bee populations.

How we maintain this bee-friendly ecosystem, in a city which is constantly constructing on any spare ground, is another challenge.

But with a clock that gives us a mere four years of survival after the disappearance of bees, it’s not one we can afford to lose.

How can we help bees? ‘Plant for pollinators, and don’t manage the open spaces so they are effectively green deserts (such as mowing park grass too closely, leading to loss of foraging ground for bees),’ said Tristram Sutton. ‘Those green deserts don’t support insect population.’ ‘We’re trying to give them new habitats to grow and prosper in’, concludes James. It’s for the future of our own species, as much as for the bees. Aiding the life of a bee: keep wild spaces in urban centres

ensure a wild flower mix is used in gardens, parks and flower beds

avoid spraying potent mixes of chemicals on plants

plant vegetable and fruit plants

plant herbs, such as Rosemary and Thyme

avoid synthetic grass, this does nothing to aid any wildlife

We will miss you!”

Santo’s death came three weeks after that of Dave Niehaus, the Seattle Mariners’ announcer since their inception. In May, one of baseball’s greatest voices, Ernie Harwell, died of cancer at 92, and thousands paid their respects to him inside the front gates at Comerica Park, where he lay in repose.

“He was like family to us,” one Harwell mourner said.

A year earlier, Harry Kalas who endeared himself to Phillies fans for four decades, died before a game in the Washington Nationals’ broadcast booth — an apt, if terribly sad, way to say goodbye.

The Harwell-Niehaus-Kalas generation is fading. Fortunately, its torchbearer, Vin Scully, who just turned 83, is still vital and behind the Dodgers’ microphone. Bob Uecker, 40 years into his Brewers tenure, is almost 77 and is recovering from his second heart operation this year. Jerry Coleman, 86, still calls Padres games, and Joe Garagiola, 84, calls some Diamondbacks games.

They connect with fans because of their skills, their tenure and their authenticity. Santo lacked Scully-like skills, but it did not matter. Nor did it matter for Phil Rizzuto. Sometimes, you love an announcer like Santo for the fun he brought to fans who identified with his passion.

“In life, as in broadcasting, the greatest indictment is if you’re a fraud,” said Curt Smith, an author of books about baseball broadcasting and biographies of Scully and Mel Allen. “Santo wasn’t. He never presented himself as a professional who did his homework, even if he did it; he certainly knew baseball. If you were a Cubs fan, he was your guy, he loved your team, you loved him, and he loved the city you loved.”

He added: “God bless him. He wasn’t one of those robotic clones who numb you.”

Charley Steiner, who calls Dodgers games on radio and observes Scully as a colleague, understands the integral role radio broadcasters play.

“They’re the background music of summer,” he said. “They’re home plate. They’re going to be there at 1 in the afternoon or 7 at night. There’s a sense of reliability, stability, entertainment, comfort — and oh, by the way, there’s a game.”

Fourteen years after Allen’s death — and 46 years after he lost his job calling the Yankees — he is still fondly remembered by fans of an advanced age. His Southern accent, his expressions and his nearly annual presence calling the World Series are still part of his fans’ reality.

The remarks of the rabbi who eulogized him at his funeral could have applied to many of baseball’s greatest voices. “Mel Allen’s life was one long, extended, exhaustive, triumphant prayer,” he said, “a call to us to see the sublimities of the stolen sign or the first seasonal shifts of the wind.”

Santo was not a play-by-play announcer like Allen, or nearly all the baseball voices most often lionized. But he wanted happy endings for the Cubs as Allen did for the Yankees, although he expressed it as the raw, eternally adolescent id of the games that he called with Pat Hughes.

Hughes, who also worked beside Uecker in Milwaukee, said: “You can take Larry Bird with the Celtics, Jerry Rice with the 49ers or Wayne Gretzky with Edmonton, and no other star player ever loved his former team more than Santo. He loved the organization, the fans and Wrigley Field. He was genuine. He spoke from the heart. He wasn’t trying to fool anybody.”

Hughes recalled standing for the national anthem with Santo in the Shea Stadium radio booth in 2003 when the heater above them ignited Santo’s favorite hairpiece.

“I saw smoke coming out of his hair and he was rubbing his head,” Hughes said. “I said, ‘Man, what did you do?’ He hadn’t noticed how close he was to the heater. I took a cup of water and doused it.”

Santo wore it during the game despite looking as if a “golfer had whacked a divot in it,” Hughes said. He eventually discarded it but had three others, one worse than the next.

Steiner admired the on-air camaraderie of Hughes and Santo.

“Pat was Bud Abbott,” he said, “and just let Ron fly.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0000205-e7370851a9e0bb9a33debe3bfaba9685.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004416 00000000000 015320  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The rollout of the prekindergarten program has gone relatively smoothly, although some parents have complained that there are not enough seats available in certain neighborhoods, like the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

Experts have generally said the program is of good quality, considering that the initiative is still new. The city regularly evaluates its preschool providers using a nationally recognized scale for early childhood programs. The average scores from the city’s first two years were significantly below the average for classrooms in New Jersey’s Abbott Preschool Program, a highly regarded preschool effort. But they were similar to those of Abbott classrooms in that program’s early years.

While close to 70,000 children are enrolled in the city’s program for 4-year-olds, there are currently just 11,000 publicly financed seats for 3-year-olds in early childhood centers, and they are available only to families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $49,200 for a family of four.

In contrast to the program for 4-year-olds, which tripled the number of prekindergarten seats in two years, the new plan would be rolled out over four years. The program would start in two of the city’s lowest-income school districts, District 7 in the Bronx and District 23 in Brooklyn, and offer a seat to every 3-year-old in those districts by the fall of 2018. The city would expand the program to an additional six districts, still to be chosen, by the fall of 2020 and to all districts by 2021.

The mayor said that the city was putting $36 million in next year’s budget to finance the program and that it planned to spend $177 million annually on the program at full scale, on top of the $200 million it currently spends on seats for 3-year-olds from low-income families. But the program will cost much more than that — more than $1 billion — and Mr. de Blasio said he expected the state and federal governments to step up to help.

“We will build a coalition to put together whatever state and federal resources we need to bring this to full fruition,” the mayor said.

Whether those resources will be forthcoming is unclear. Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, has said little about early childhood education, and it was not a focus of hers as a philanthropist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0000052-f2590551437c98b0c54b2eaf3f416209.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005503 00000000000 014654  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, said that he has received over 500 complaints of price gouging during this emergency.

In the midst of natural disasters and other catastrophes, we expect the community around us to to pitch in to help those suffering. While many people have stepped up during Hurricane Harvey, some have used this opportunity to make money off the desperation of those victimized by the disaster.

In the case of Harvey, we have seen some of the best of people, with many Houstonians going to great lengths to help their neighbors and even total strangers in this difficult time. Unfortunately, there have also been numerous cases where businesses have price-gouged victims of this calamity, US News reports.

Price gouging, which is illegal in Texas, typically happens when companies sell essential items like food, gas, and water for higher prices, or add fees during a state of emergency.

On Saturday at a Wingstop franchise location in Corpus Christi, Tex., customers were charged an extra $5 fee on orders at the restaurant, listed on their receipts as a “catering dish.”

After customers complained to the corporate headquarters of Wingstop, the company refunded the affected customers and gave them free gift cards.

In another instance, a Best Buy in Houston was reportedly selling 24-packs of water for $42.96, an enormous markup from the average price of a pack of water.

Hey @BestBuy you want to explain why this store of yours in Houston is illegally price gouging? pic.twitter.com/803tuo4XLm — Max Cotterill ???? (@mcotteri) August 29, 2017

Spokesmen from the company explained that Best Buy does not typically sell water by the pack, and employees mistakingly were selling the packs at the price of 24 individual water bottles.

Local gas stations have also been accused of price gouging, with one customer at one nearby Raceway gas station and convenience store claiming overcharges for items like energy drinks and beer, as well as gas at the pump.

One customer says he saw a woman charged $60 for two cases of beer.

Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, said that his office has received over 500 complaints of price gouging during Harvey.

Anyone who believes they have experienced price gouging in the aftermath of or during this storm can file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General’s office on their website. In Texas, price gougers face fines of up to $250,000 per offense.

Sure, it was snowing in Southeast Michigan in late April. But based on every preceding year since 1850, when temperature records began in earnest, Metro Detroit is heading into warmer weather. And with the warmer weather, many area brewers have begun crafting lighter, and sometimes-fruitier beers to accompany the more comfortable climate. Below are some of the spring and summer offerings being made by arguably some of Southeast Michigan's finest beer brewers. If you feel we're missing someone, let us know, we'd be happy to add them. Home brewers do not count (this time).

Detroit Beer Co.

Detroit Beer Co. is brewing a “313,” which head brewer Nate Ryske says is “basically a hopped up pilsner.” The restaurant/brewery is also doing a peach witbier, which is a Belgian style beer with peach pit in it. There’s a brown ale too, which is more for fall, but why not, Ryske said. “And since we’re right by Comerica Park, we do a Baseball Beer every year. I got that on tap right now and another batch coming up.” The Baseball Beer is a pale ale with dry hops and cascade hops.This week they’re also planning to do a Belgian Tripel – a strong, "hoppy" beer with high Alcohol By Volume (ABV) content (about 10 %).

Traffic Jam and Snug

Traffic Jam and Snug, perhaps better known for food offerings, is brewing two special beers for the season. It has a Ryebock, which is a play on the German Maibock spring beer “with a heavy does of rye,” head brewer Chris Reilly said. Reilly also brewed an imperial wit and a Belgian wheat beer. He said he will soon do another batch of India Pale Ales.

Motor City Brewing Works

There is a double bock that’s only available in the tap room at Motor City Brewing Works. It accompanies another spring, tap room-only brew, the imperial stout. The next beer that will be brought out for summer distribution, called Summer Brew, is an American wheat beer brewed with honey and orange peels. “We’ve been doing that for about six years,” said Daniel Scarsella, director of operations.

Atwater Brewery

The Summertime Ale is already on tap at Atwater Brewery. It’s a light-amber in color, and features Vienna malt and dark wheat, said Jason Schrider, director of operations. “It gets about ten minutes exposure to ground lemon peel while it’s still hot,” Schrider said. “It’s a light, easy drinker, and the Vienna malt and the wheat make it real crisp.” The brewery is also doing a Maibock, a variety of hop-ier beers, and a run of fruity cascades and "super cascade knock-offs." The brewery also released its summer variety packs, which include four six packs of Summertime Ale, Traverse City Cherry Wheat, Purple Gang Pilsner and Dirty Blonde.

Woodward Avenue Brewers

Woodward Avenue Brewers, often referred to as simply “WAB,” has six spring beers on tap and four beers on “guest taps." WAB’s own beers are the Custom Blonde, the Raspberry Blonde, the Detroit Maiden IPA, the Czech Engine Light Pilsner, the Czech Amber and the Gluten-Less Maximus IPA. The guest taps have 3 Mile Marker Hefe Weizen from Midland Brewery, North Coast Red Seal, Atwater Vanilla Java Porter and Uncle John’s Hard Apple Cider.

Kuhnhenn Brewing Company

This Warren-based brewery is “staying constant” with full run of pale ales, production manager and cellar master Todd Schwem said. The brewery will soon crack out a hefeweizen, different wheat beers, and panty-droppers. “The panty dropper is basically the base beer, our classic American,” Schwem said. It’s a session beer that is infused with fresh strawberries, blue berries, raspberries or oranges. “It’s a panty dropper because ladies drink it,” Schwem said.

Falling Down Beer Company

Falling Down Beer company, which just opened a few weeks ago in Warren, has the following on tap: Ninja Chicken Pale Ale, Angry Beaver Double Brown, Cherry Blonde, IPA, Belma Pale Ale, Green Tea IPA, Muscovado Stout, Test Batch Stout (Session Stout), and Amber Ale.

Dragonmeade Microbrewery

Dragonmeade Microbrewery, based in Warren, has a lighter, Gemrna-style lager on tap for spring that it is calling Tuhelles Enbock. It also has the Armageddon Grand Cru, a Belgian-style quad that “lives up to its name and then some.” It has an ABV of 11.6 %. Rounding out its trio of current brews is the Wench Water Belgian Pale Ale, a golden-colored beer that is brewed with Belgian Candi Sugar and coriander, as well as sweet orange peel. The brewery also still has bourbon-cask beers.

Grizzly Peak Brewing Company

Head brewer Duncan Williams said this Ann Arbor brewery still has some brews left on tap from the city’s annual FestiFools, but some new ones are in the works for the coming weeks. One is The Mighty Willamette Bitter. It’s an English-style, "hoppy" beer, but the Willamette hops make it distinctly American. The brewery is working on a Bavarian-style hefeweizen, called El Hefe. Williams said he’s also working on Belgian Saisonaire or farmhouse ale, with all Michigan hops and malt, that will be coming in late spring or early summer.

Arbor Brewing Company

Also in the Ann Arbor area, Arbor Brewing Company owners Rene and Matt Greff are collaborating with their peers at the Troubadour brewery in Belgium. The Greffs brewed a rye Tripel for the Belgians, and the Troubadour folks came to the Corner Brewery in Ypsilanti to do a chocolate rye double. At Arbor Brewing Company, three taps are going to be Toubadours, and two will be Amero-Belgian collaborations between the brewers, according to bar manager Ryan Luttermoser. Then, on Cinco de Mayo, the breweyr will release a dark Mexican lager. It is also releasing a Maibock on May 9. In June, the brewery will being doing fruitier session beers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0000060-3d908fe9b8d6829fcefda5347b934aae.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012467 00000000000 015352  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Yesterday we published a brief account of an apparent massacre in the Palestinian village Khuza’a, a village east of Khan Younis and close to the Israeli border in Gaza. That had been sent to Felice Gelman over Facebook and today, Yamen Radwan sent Gelman another brief message: “#Massacre_Khuza’a: stilling going on until now executions of civilians and wounded by Israeli forces in the streets of Khuza’a.”

News reports of what happened, or is happening, in Khuza’a remain vague. Above, from Al Jazeera, is the only video news report we’ve been able to find. National Public Radio’s Emily Harris just now reported a telephone conversation with a woman who escaped the village after two days in a basement and who said that snipers were shooting people in the streets.

The Gaza NGO Palestinian Centre for Human Rights included these details from Khuza’a in an daily report it issued today covering events from yesterday:

At approximately 12:30, Israel forces that had moved into Khuza’a village, east of Khan Yunis, fired bullets and artillery shells at hundreds of Palestinian civilians who attempted to leave the village as there were reports about a one-hour coordination to evacuate casualties. Israeli forces fired also at ambulances and prevented them from entering the village. At approximately 17:00, 12 ambulances attempted to enter Khuza’a village, but Israeli forces prevented and fired at them. At approximately 18:30, an Israeli warplane launched a missile at a house belonging to Dr. Kamal Abu Rujaila, which he uses as clinic, in Khuza’a village, as a number of wounded Palestinians went to the house seeking medical aid. A number of casualties were reported as a result of the attack. Apparently, one Palestinian was killed. Medical crews were not able to reach the house. A volunteer paramedic, who was wounded throughout the body while he was attempting to evacuate wounded Palestinians, has been trapped in the area since Wednesday morning, 23 July 2014, as medical crews have not been able to reach him. According to reports from Khuza’a village, Israeli forces raided a number of houses and turned them into military sites. They also arrested scores of Palestinians. At approximately 23:00, an ICRC crew and 10 ambulances of Palestine Red Crescent Society went to Kuza’a village, but they were not able to evacuate victims because the situation was extremely dangerous. At approximately 21:00, an Israeli warplane launched a missile at a number of Palestinian civilians in Khuza’a village, east of Khan Yunis, killing 2 of them: Mohammed Barham Abu Draz, 24; and ‘Essam Ibrahim Abu Ismail, 23. At approximately 06:50, Israeli forces fired at dozens of Palestinian civilians who raised white flags and attempted to leave Khuza’a village, and forced them to go back homes. At approximately 07:15, Israeli forces fired at a number of Palestinian civilians who attempted to leave Khuza’a through a dirt road leading to ‘Abassan village. One of these civilians, Mohammed Ahmed Suleiman al-Najjar, 56, was killed by a bullet to the neck. Two civilians were also wounded. Also at approximately 08:30, medical crews were able to recover the body of Fadi Yousef Ahmed al-Najjar, 27, who is physically disabled, from Khuza’a village. He was killed by Israeli shelling. At approximately 09:50, an Israeli drone fired a missile at a motor cart on which a number of Palestinian civilians were traveling attempting to leave Khuza’a village. As a result, 4 civilians were killed and another 2 ones were wounded. The victims have not been identified as their bodies were burnt.

This account is consistent with social media. The most complete comes from Khuza’a resident Mahmoud Ismail who tweeted out updates from the village. They were translated by Mohammad Alsaafin who retweeted them. The updates read:

Account: My family & I made it out, light injuries. Hundreds of casualties, bodies in the streets. Many of the dead in Khuza’a bled to death bc ambulances unable to reach. From my window I watched a 20 yr old die for hours. One doctor, Kamal Abu Rjeila, treated injuries that came into his clinic even after it was bombed & his father killed. The Israeli army used ten families as human shields. They took over their homes and wouldn’t let them escape.Home I was sheltering in with 50 others was bombed. I don’t know what happened to them but my shoes soaked in their blood. We escaped to our home under the cover of the dust from the bombing. Minutes later, it was hit by 3 artillery shells. We tried to escape on foot to Khuzaa’s exit, but helicopters fired on us. I saw a woman carrying her dead child in one arm and a white flag in the other. She used the white flag to wrap his body. As we walked I saw my uncle and his son, dead on the road next to their house. Snipers were hitting people in the legs. My other cousin died trying to save his bleeding brother in the street. They died on top of each other. There are corpses still lying in the streets, injured people waiting to become corpses, families who still haven’t escaped

The village was also attacked during Cast Lead, the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2009. The definitive report on the conflict by the UN Human Rights Council, the Goldstone Report of 2009, documented Israeli sniper killings of civilians in the village, and the prevention of ambulances from arriving to take the wounded away:                                                                                                                                                                                                         0000222-a26c0ce11b9d6b9c84bea1498ba5593e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004330 00000000000 015231  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Nearly $900 million from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund was handed out across the country Tuesday, with the largest portion coming to Dalhousie University in Halifax.

“Dalhousie University will receive $93.7 million of this funding,” said Treasury Board President Scott Brison. “Today’s announcement will demonstrate to Canadians and to the world that in Canada science is back.”

The federal funding combined with support from provincial governments in the Maritimes, partners and a donation of $25 million from prominent business leader John Risley brings the total investment in a new initiative called the Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI) to $220 million.

“This massive investment in ocean science between the government of Canada and its many partners, the donors will take Canada from world class to world leader, and what better place for this visionary investment than right here in Atlantic Canada,” said Dalhousie President Richard Florizone.

“We are entirely up to this challenge.”

Risley wasn’t at Tuesday’s announcement but did provide a written statement.

“I have every confidence that the OFI can become an engine for regional economic growth and firmly establish us as global leaders in ocean science,” the statement reads.

The institute will focus on understanding key aspects of the ocean and ecosystem change. Experts say if they’re able know what’s happening now, it will help them predict changes that may come in the future and adjust properly.

The main office for the OFI will be located in Halifax, but Dalhousie will be partnering with Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador and the University of Prince Edward Island for the seven-year project.

“Today, we witness an historic partnership,” said Dr. Richard Marceau, vice president of research at Memorial University.

“A partnership that inoculates a world-leading university alliance that places new direction in ocean research, that recognizes Canada as an oceans nation and shows what can be accomplished when Atlantic Canada partners with Atlantic Canada.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000168-b0e4a8bba200a0ea516e364b687e19e4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001663 00000000000 015146  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        EAST RUTHERFORD — Former Bergen County Prosecutor and assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Fahy was found dead Wednesday under the Bergen Line bridge over Route 17.

He died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, East Rutherford Police Chief Larry Minda said.

Two men found his body at about 5 p.m., Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said. Police closed Route 17 southbound while they investigated the scene.

An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday. Molinelli said investigators don't suspect foul play.

Police have recovered a handgun at the scene, Molinelli said.

Fahy appeared to have walked to the underpass, as his vehicle was found at his Rutherford home.

Fahy was the Bergen County Prosecutor from 1990 to 1995, and was a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Newark. He also served as the Carlstadt municipal attorney and was a partner in his firm Fahy-Choi in Rutherford.

The City of Gatineau issued the preventive advisory at 2 p.m. Saturday after maintenance work caused a drop in water pressure, said Jean Boileau, the city's director of communications.

Preventive boil water advisory for 2 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gatineau?src=hash">#Gatineau</a> sectors <a href="https://t.co/aCLG4f0dfq">https://t.co/aCLG4f0dfq</a> <a href="https://t.co/4ONzwaFsaZ">pic.twitter.com/4ONzwaFsaZ</a> —@ville_gatineau

People living in the two affected areas in the city's Limbour district should boil their water for at least one minute before drinking it, the city said in a statement.

If the water appears brown, people should run their cold water taps until it appears clear again, the city said.

Tap water can still be used safely for bathing, showering, and doing laundry or dishes.

The city said it would notify residents as soon as the advisory is lifted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000085-a25087bdd17f7bdfe756c22388126ebb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004137 00000000000 015171  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, denies secret payments from Ukraine

Donald Trump's top political aide is denying a news report that he received $12.7 million in secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

"I have never received a single 'off-the-books cash payment' as falsely 'reported' by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia," Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said in a statement.

Manafort, who did work for the party led by the pro-Russian former Ukrainian president Viktor F. Yanukovych, also said that "I am a campaign professional" and "it is well known that I do work in the United States and have done work on overseas campaigns as well."

The New York Times reports that "handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine’s newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau."

The report added: "Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials."

The story broke shortly before Trump was set to deliver a foreign policy speech Monday at Youngstown State University in Ohio.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called the Times report more evidence of "troubling connections" between Trump's team and "pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine."

Trump "has a responsibility to disclose campaign chair Paul Manafort's and all other campaign employees' and advisers' ties to Russian or pro-Kremlin entities, including whether any of Trump's employees or advisers are currently representing and or being paid by them," Mook said.

In his statement, Manafort said that "all of the political payments directed to me were for my entire political team: campaign staff (local and international), polling and research, election integrity and television advertising. The suggestion that I accepted cash payments is unfounded, silly and nonsensical."

The party's candidates held news conferences around the region Thursday to lay out numbers, mostly dollar figures, that an NDP government would put in place.

The party says it would spend $157 million on infrastructure in New Brunswick over four years.



But Saint John-Rothesay candidate A.J. Griffin, speaking to reporters at her campaign office, was unable to say how the party arrived at that figure.



"We've spent a great deal of time creating these budgets, and if you want, we can provide you with greater details in writing," she said.

"It's too large for a 10-second soundbite."



Griffin was also unable to say whether a promise to restore annual six per cent increases in federal health transfers would take into account New Brunswick's aging population.

Candidate can't give specifics

In a letter to all party leaders in July, Premier Brian Gallant said Ottawa's new per person funding formula penalizes provinces with aging populations, like New Brunswick, because seniors require more expensive care.

Griffin couldn't say whether the NDP promise would address that.

The best way to get change in Ottawa and the only way to stop Stephen Harper is to vote NDP. - A.J. Griffin, NDP candidate





"The costs are all outlined in that document and we can get a further breakdown from the federal party if you so desire," she said.



Campaign officials later explained that the infrastructure amount is based on a plan to increase the proportion of federal gas tax revenue that is turned over to municipalities.



And they said the health transfers would include funding for senior care, though the precise amount to cover aging populations would have to be negotiated with the provinces by an NDP government.



The NDP platform also promises 50,000 child care spaces in Atlantic Canada as part of its national daycare program, and more support for industries in the region such as fishing and forestry.



The release of the platform specifics comes as the NDP is fighting back a push by the Liberals to persuade people to vote strategically.



In Saint John, Liberal candidate Wayne Long has been openly telling voters that he is ahead in polling done by a strategic-voting lobby group, LeadNow, and New Democrats who want to defeat incumbent Conservative Rodney Weston have to vote Liberal.



"We certainly are in that position," he said. 'Anybody who looks at any polling sees that Rodney and I are in a neck-and-neck battle and the NDP is falling off."



Griffin, however, touted the NDP's commitment to change federal policies while running a balanced budget, a contrast with the Liberal plan to run short-term deficits.

"The best way to get change in Ottawa and the only way to stop Stephen Harper is to vote NDP," she said.

Weston, who will benefit if Liberal and NDP voters remain split, says the NDP is still "a serious contender" in Saint John, and he criticized Long for urging strategic voting.



"People don't vote for people based on what you're trying to undo or stop," he said.



But he dismissed the NDP's big-budget promises on infrastructure, saying the Harper Conservatives has already put in place "the largest infrastructure program and the longest-running infrastructure program in Canadian history."

Among other things, that program provided $68 million for an upgrade of the Port of Saint John.



No firm stand on Energy East pipeline

Griffin refused Thursday to come out for or against the Energy East pipeline, a position she has stuck with throughout the campaign.



The proposed pipeline, which would carry Alberta crude to Saint John for export and refining, is popular in the city.

The NDP says it can't say whether the project would be approved because there isn't a proper regulatory mechanism in place.



"Our focus is on establishing credible review processes," she said. "This has not worked so far."



Andrew Graham, the NDP candidate in neighbouring New Brunswick Southwest, went further.

He said approval of Energy East is impossible with "the current degradation of federal oversight" and "the corruption of the National Energy Board," which will be holding hearings into the project.



He also said given the low price of oil, "it is not even worthwhile getting that oil out of the ground. ... It is not feasible."                                                                                                                                                        0000139-14817a71da254dab8cea26d4dc8d68a3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004363 00000000000 015240  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        While not technically a National Park (there are a lot of rock outcroppings along the shoreline which are all part of the California Coastal National Monument), Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, CA is definitely worth a visit. It’s not often that you see a beach that is almost entirely made of sea glass (also called beach glass, mermaids tears, lucky glass, ocean glass and sea gems) that is several inches thick in some places:

Most people assume that sea glass comes from glass garbage dumped out at sea that eventually makes its way to the shore. In many cases, this is how sea glass arrives on the beach, but not in the case of Glass Beach in Fort Bragg. Instead, the glass has been there for up to 100 years getting churned by ocean waves and sand.

Towns along the sea coast used to dump all their garbage into the oceans. In most areas, the tide would come in and sweep all the garbage out to sea, but the rock formations at Fort Bragg create a unique wave pattern that kept everything on the beach. Basically, all the glass garbage that was dumped in the Fort Bragg dumps from 1906 – 1967 remains where it was dumped and over the years the sand and tides have smoothed the sharp glass into smooth, rounded sea glass pebbles of many different colors making the entire beach a “glass beach.” It also has resulted in Fort Bragg having the highest concentration of sea glass in the world.

It’s a pretty incredible sight with the sea glass several inches thick in some areas. It also makes for excellent foreground photographs of the California Coastal National Monument outcroppings just off the coast:

Here is a short video I took at Glass Beach:

There are actually 3 Glass Beaches in Fort Bragg. The one that is most famous is part of MacKerricher State Park (CA) and was the Fort Bragg dump from 1949 – 1967. I took these photos and video at the 1943 – 1949 dump site which is just south of MacKerricher State Park. There is another dump site that ran from 1906 – 1943, but it’s only accessible by sea kayak.

For those interested in directions how to get to 1943 – 1949 dump site, there is a Glass Beach Museum on highway 1 toward the south end of Fort Bragg where you can get a map of all the glass beaches in Fort Bragg (and see an amazing display of sea glass).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000095-afe749d363d6d87a075331973dcd29e8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000027445 00000000000 015063  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Next Chapter >

In the days before Formula D New Jersey Vaughn Gittin JR was nice enough to let me into his Maryland home for a night, and being the nosy Speedhunter that I am, I decided to do a little piece on his house.

As soon as I arrived at JR’s, I found this beat up Suby.

Inside was the Monster drifter himself. I hopped in and I didn’t really know what to expect. I asked “where are we going?”, but Vaughn just smiled and said “out back”.

As we were about to take off, Chris Forsberg pulls up to say hello. I thought to myself, what kind of backwards world of drift is this?. Were these top drifters just hanging around all the time or something?

With a smile on his face, Vaughn knew my mind would soon be blown away.

So this is what JR meant when he said “out back”.’ It was a rock/clay quarry. Mind blown.

This is where Vaughn gets his “hand-eye coordination practice”.

I held on for my life as I got hit in the face with my own camera quite a few times. I do have to admit though it was quite smooth going around this improvised rally course.

He explained that during the United States Independence day, which is coming up very soon, there are many fireworks shows that go on all around. From the area on top of the mountain you can see all of them for free. Wonderful.

Also joining us for some off road fun was up and coming drifter Nate Hamilton.

I asked Vaughn before if he would ever live anywhere else and he said no. He loves Maryland and I can see why.

Even Vaughn’s and Chris’ wives came out to join in on the off road fun.

Next was a tour of Vaughn’s garage, which was still a work in progress.

This was it, in all its air conditioned glory. On the bottom is the garage, and on top is a man cave/office which was not finished yet.

Inside was his personal drift museum. It also brought back lots of memories for me too, as I have been shooting drifting since 2004.

Under that cover was one of the most famous pieces of American drift history. Vaughn got his first win in D1 with this car, as well as winning D1 USA vs. Japan.

The last time he drove this car was in 2008 for the Redbull World Drift Championship. He’s since fixed the body damage from that event and it’s been parked ever since.

I remember the Red Bull event like it was yesterday. He actually owns this car and he plans to restore it to its former glory to drive in drift demonstrations.

Even older was his S13 that he drove in for the very first season of Formula Drift back in 2004.

It’s definitely seen better days but, just like the Mustang he plans on restoring this car to exactly how it was back in 2004. To think that he trailered this car on his open trailer in his pickup truck to all the stops back in 2004 just blows my mind.

I remember the last time I saw this car run was in China for the 2006 Beijing drift demo.

Both of the cars had quite a thick layer of dust on them.

They also still had ancient URL decals on them too. WhereToDrift.com was Vaughn’s website that he made to promote legal drifting to keep it off public roads.

On the left ,was the very first tech sticker used for Formula Drift back in 2004 and on the right was a tech sticker from 2006 on his Mustang.

The wheel on his S13 was so incredibly smooth from all that seat time.

Also in the garage was a copy of his current competition car that he uses for demonstrations.

He then brought me to the next room, where most of the wrenching will be done.

That RTR was the very first prototype ever built, and JR is very proud of it.

In front, was a lift in case he needs to tackle a more serious project.

This is his new missile car, but it ‘s not just any Fox Mustang.

It’s was actually the very first Fox Mustang turned into a drift car, even before Dan Pina’s drift patrol car.

It was originally owned by the creator of Driftlive.com and now it’s Vaughn’s personal hooning machine.

With a couple quick additions from ASD this thing was ready to rip.

Again, I remember seeing this car get flogged around the west coast maybe 5 to 6 years ago. Vaughn’s actually been in the market for a Fox bodied Mustang for a while now and when he heard this one was for sale, he jumped on it. The next time he was in California he swung by and picked it up and the rest is history.

Out front, was his giant six-car transport and parked next to that was the prototype 2013 Mustang RTR which I had the pleasure of driving for the weekend. Keep an eye out for that article in the near future.

Various other things laying around the house were remnants of target practice sessions, this was America after all…

…as well as piles and piles of used tires.

Some of his other rally vehicles include this AE86. Notice the custom flood lights on top. This rally car looked like it needed some work.

Next up was his Subaru Legacy. I was offered to drive it, but it must have known I was coming because it did not start for some reason.

It was time to go inside a relax for a bit, because following was big work day for everyone including me.

I got an interesting vibe as soon as I went inside. Vaughn and his wife Abby are pretty crazy about crabs, as I was about to find out first hand.

That night I ate 12 crabs. It must have been the Chinese side of me kicking it because I made sure there was no meat left in every nook and cranny of those tasty crustaceans.

After a quick bonfire it was time to hit the sack. The next morning I would interview Vaughn and head to New York to get some nice photographs of the RTR.

The next morning I woke up to the smell of crispy bacon and this weird green-colored juice. Apparently Vaughn and Abby are really into juicing. In fact he bought a juicer when we were in China last year. That is when I tried pure ginger juice, and that night I cried myself to sleep.

I decided to poke around a bit before I had to hit the road. This is Abby’s office. When Vaughn needs to get in contact with Abby he emails her, even though they are next door to each other. Cute.

I spy a Rodfather decal on there, as well as some other Speedhunter related decals.

Around the house were some very interesting pieces of art…

…as well as this “performance art” that Vaughn did with his Mustang. Below is his most prized trophy, the 2010 Formula Drift Championship cup.

This must be were the magic happens. Vaughn’s office was very simple but it had lots of mementos that he has collected over the years.

Soon all of this stuff will be transported into the man cave, but for now it was out in the open so let’s dive right in.

I just love these cheesy magazine titles, although I don’t know if they have gotten any better over the years.

You can even see the evolution of collages over the years.

Among his many carbon fiber trophies was the SEMA display for his MegaBlock RTR-X model.

On the left looks like an old lexan 1/10 scale RC body painted in Falken colors. Those shoes were custom made for Vaughn by DC and he has a few of those laying around the house gathering dust.

That was his very first helmet and the last time he wore it was driving his Mustang in D1.

On top of the shelf were many many more trophies…

…as well as photos of his first competition car and his very first DVD. I wish Speedhunting was always easy as taking a photo of another photo.

Vaughn won the Hardest Charger award two years in a row. Our very own Matt Powers won the same award last year. Apparently back then there was a “Jaeger Award” for the biggest party animal. I think Formula Drift needs to bring that back. Vaughn has won that award back to back as well.

There was quite the collection of hats as well. This probably has to do with the “hat dance”.’ If you Speedhunters out there have ever been to an event you probably know what I am talking about. Whenever these guys get on the podium they have to change to different hats for different sponsors. It’s the funniest thing and it somehow reminds me of this.

One of the most important trophies for Vaughn was the one that started his championship run back in 2010.

This is quite the impressive lanyard collection, but wait until you guys see mine.

I thought this was interesting. Vaughn gave John Force a ride back in 2009 and thought it was so cool that he kept the waiver that John signed as well as a photo of course.

All the way in the corner was his very first trophy from a drift competition at Hyperfest back in 2003. It was just a single run competition. No tandem!

Another trophy that meant a lot to him was his D1 All Star World Championship trophy.

This was his very first magazine spread. Holy wow an S13 with 375 wheel horsepower? Now I’ve seen everything!

On top of the Magazine articles there were these newspaper articles that have lots of meaning to the Gittins as well, including this piece from USA today. That was the first time drifting was mentioned in a national newspaper.

This local newspaper did a feature on Vaughn and it means a lot to him since he used to deliver this exact paper when he was a boy.

What was also apparent about the house was the love for dogs.

I have to admit I have a soft spot for animals too and I could just die after seeing how sweet Brody Gittin was.

What also peaked my interest was the love of photographs. I’ve never seen so many photographs plastered around a house. I’m a photographer and I don’t have nearly as many photos around my place.

I also stumbled upon a book that I was very proud of. Hopefully one day you guys will get to own a copy of your own.

Now it was on to his living room, where many more treasures lived.

It’s a good thing Maryland is not known for having earthquakes.

This tail light belonged to his wife (then girlfriend) Abby’s S13. He drifted it in the rain which resulted in a busted rear half of the car. I’m not sure what happened to the rest of the car.

This was a cool little diorama of the chase scene from Bullitt.

It looked like somebody in the house was a Simpsons fan. I can relate to that, although I wouldn’t be able to hit a golf ball with a hockey stick if my life depended on it.

This is an interesting poster of the four original Drift Alliance members. I wonder what ever happened to Ryan Hampton?

On the left is his original racing suit that he wore when he first started driving with Falken Tire. On the right is more stuff he has collected over the years, including another pair of those custom DC shoes.

This was a wedding gift from the ASD guys, signed by the entire crew.

I don’t even know what to say about this one. Right in the middle ia his wedding cake topper.

Who wouldn’t want their own bar? Vaughn’s home bar has memorabilia from all over the world that he’s collected over the years…

…but out of all of the memorabilia, this drawing had the most interesting story. Back in 2003 Vaughn maxed out all his credit cards to make it to California for the first time ever, just to drive at a drift event on the west coast. At the time Drift Alliance was already formed, but it was only in it’s infancy. Chris Forsberg and Tony Angelo were also there, so they go out to a bar one night in my hometown of Santa Monica and outside of said bar was a homeless man who happened to be drawing tourists for a small fee. Vaughn paid that guy to draw him and his friends at the bar. I’d say they got their money’s worth.

More picture books were laying around for my prying eyes. These were a chronicle of the drifter’s life for a year.

No living room would be complete without a simulation station.

There was even some Speedhunters supplied wall art. This one was probably shot by Linhbergh.

I bothered the happy couple for long enough, so after my interview with Vaughn I left for my long journey in the new RTR. Stay tuned for both of these articles.

Here is a question to you Speedhunters out there, who’s house should I invade next?

This wasn’t, of course, a genuine news story, but a Halfords press release from some months back, that has only just filtered through to the Horsham Advertiser – the company in question conducts some research, and then presents it as a piece of news that local newspapers can swallow up, using as content to fill their pages, in exchange for a plug for the company that commissioned the research. Everybody wins. (This is similar to the method that results in spurious mathematical equations constantly appearing in the media as ‘news’ – a transparent attempt to get a company free publicity in exchange for paying a scientist to prostitute themselves).

The facts and figures contained within such an article should therefore, of course, by treated with some caution, but with that caveat, this research is rather revealing.

By the time his children are 18, the average Dad has spent the equivalent of a whole working year Taxi-ing his children around. In fact modern Dads spend more time ferrying kids than almost anything else they do – apart from work and sleep. That’s more time than they spend in the garden, on DIY and even in the pub. Dads clock up an average 25 miles a week on 2.33 journeys, taking their youngsters to school, sports and social events – or 2hrs 16mins driving. A fith (20%) of dads, however, admitted to undertaking a journey of over 100 miles and 7% over 200 miles… A dedicated one in eight (17%) of fathers do more than five trips a week. Over four in five (81%) give lifts to the children of friends and neighbours. There then comes the inevitable, crowbarred-in soundbite from someone at Halfords – Rory Carlin, Halfords Autocentres Marketing Director said: “We spend a lot of our time caring for family cars to help customers live their lives on the move.We can’t do anything about our kids’ increasingly hectic social lives or the rising cost of fuel, but we can help by making routine servicing, maintenance and tyres affordable and accessible. We’re working hard to bring down the cost of motoring because we understand that dedication comes at a cost, both in terms of the fuel used and wear and tear on the car itself.” Fair enough. Probably a good idea to look after your car, if you’re spending that much time driving your children about. But Rory Carlin misdiagnoses the problem. Fathers are not driving their children around because of their ‘increasingly hectic social lives.’ At a guess, I would suspect that children are making fewer trips to visit their friends than half-a-century ago – they’re probably spending a bit more time at home, contacting them via the interweb. The problem is rather that when they come to make trips to visit friends, or to school, they are no longer making those trips by themselves. Parents either don’t trust their children to make journeys on foot or bike by themselves, or the children don’t want to. This is why fathers are – apparently – spending more time driving their children around than any other activity, except work and sleep. Dutch fathers presumably have it a little easier; the average age at which Dutch children start cycling to school by themselves is eight (as David Arditti notes, this is a source of concern to the Dutch authorities – because it is considered too old). In Assen, 100% (to the best approximation) of children cycle to school. And it’s not just the school run that parents are spared from. Visiting friends in town; sleepovers; going to the park; playing football; these are all things that children can do by themselves. Dutch cities and towns are designed to allow children to make their own way about, in a subjectively safe environment. David Hembrow assured us, on our Embassy Field Trip, that children using bikes with stabilisers can, and do, cycle into the centre of Assen city, with their parents (although they often can’t cycle back – it is some distance for young children).

Go to the Netherlands, and you will see incredibly young children cycling around.

These are children cycling home from two different primary schools, for lunch with their parents. They can do this because it’s easy.

Parents can also go shopping with their children, by bike – they don’t need to worry about packing them into cars (which was a serious concern voiced in the Understanding Walking and Cycling report) –

Teenage girls don’t need a lift into town to go shopping either – they can hop on a bike, and go with their friends (the gentleman is not their father – he’s just someone they’re about to overtake) –

The amount of time this independence must save their parents – both in leisure and work hours – is surely stupendous. We should be screaming this from the rooftops. Not only can our children be far more independent – which is good for their own well-being (as well as, tangentially, their health), but their parents no longer have to spend a vast proportion of their own time acting as a glorified taxi service. That means they have more time to relax, and also to be productive. There is a huge economic argument here. Parents can be working, instead of spending hours driving their children around (not to mention the savings that would result from the easing of the congestion caused by needless car journeys).

This isn’t some fantasy – the Netherlands is a country only just across the North Sea, one of nearest neighbours. Yet, for whatever reason, these kinds of solutions to our mobility problems are completely off the radar. I am firmly convinced that the great majority of this country’s citizens would leap at the idea of their children being able to go to school by themselves, or being able to visit their friends, by themselves; they just don’t know how it could be possible.

It’s up to us to show them how. And the Dutch tourist board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0000158-30c8a259a03f62f6cdfe93ab69b51afb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012172 00000000000 015321  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        On offense, you “take what the defense gives you,” according to Randy Wittman, even often according to pupil Bradley Beal. Even according to other brilliant basketball minds.

On one level, it makes a lot sense. The NBA is fast—24 seconds on the shot clock fast—and open shots are a luxury, not a right. If you get an open shot, you should probably take it, regardless of where you are. Because the next shot might not be open. And, for a variety of reasons, as the shot clock ticks down, teams have less of a chance of making a basket. ( ) You also want players reacting, not thinking about whether a shot in the moment is efficient or not, in theory. Maybe it’s more about how you’re training players to react (and think).

Take what the defense gives you, huh? On another level, it sounds like advice more appropriate for impatient teens in a church league. ( ) NBA basketball is intricate. Millions of dollars are paid to players and significant fractions of that are invested in strategy of all types. If the defense gives you a lane or a layup or a wide-open shot, sure, you take it.

But, in an attempt to split hairs, from a coaching/offensive philosophy perspective: is ‘taking what the defense gives you’ really a mindset you want to impose on your players? ‘Hey, whatever the defense happens to leave unattended, go ahead and settle for it. Be a squatter, if you will.’

Defenses have become increasingly complicated and in turn, so have NBA offenses. Or maybe the egg came before the chicken. Either way, such complicated defenses often aim to ‘give’ or ‘allow’ shots that will benefit them. Defensive schemes might double-team good post players off of poor shooters, for example, because the perimeter players are poor shooters (meaning the post player is more of a threat). If an offense always takes what the defense gives them, then the shots are often going to be in the hands of those who can’t shoot, theoretically.

Again, we’re splitting hairs with an interpretation of a cliché. But, in the complicated and expensive game of professional basketball, every nugget provided to players counts. I will ask again: Do you have to belittle strategy by encouraging players to just accept what is available?

So with a mantra of the maligned Randy Wittman in mind, I posed the question to Warriors coach Steve Kerr, currently leading the NBA’s second-best offense. ( )

‘Coach, you often hear a phrase, ‘We take what the defense gives us.’ Is that the right mindset to put your players in? Or would you rather make the defense give you what you want them to give you?’

It was, admittedly, and handful of tangled noodles thrown against the wall by me. It wasn’t in a ‘gotcha’ sense, but rather an earnest attempt to pick the brain of perhaps the Association’s coach of the year … and, of course, a well-versed former member if broadcast media … and, of course, the holder of five NBA championship rings.

“This is getting deep … [laughter from peanut gallery] … I have no idea,” said Kerr as he gathered how he wanted to respond.

“If I use that phrase next time I’m here, then you can ask me after the game. ( ) I don’t really think I use that phrase very often. ( )

“I think the whole point of offense is to make the defense react and to make them make multiple decisions and rotations, and hopefully they make a mistake. But the more decisions and rotations a defense has to make, the more likely they are to make a mistake. To me, that’s the idea behind the offensive philosophy for anybody—you pass, you cut, you screen, and you try to confuse the defense. So, however you want to phrase that, that’s what we try to do.”

Here’s the deal: Is the philosophy that Kerr described much different from what any other NBA coach would say? I doubt it. If Wittman were asked, he would certainly agree with Kerr. Move the ball, move the spacing, move the defense, take what’s left from the confusion created.

The Wizards must be good ball movers—as Wittman, without a scoring star, will preach. And generally they have been. But something with the offense now ain’t right, clearly. Lack of 3-point shooting, lack of trips to the free throw line, lack of drives to the basket.

Losers of 10 of 12 ( ), the Wizards last won an NBA game 17 days ago. In all of 2015, they have the NBA’s ninth-worst record. The time for soul-searching would be now, it must be now, but it might also be too late. Or, such dark hours could make the team better in the end.

Likely not since the issues seem more systemic than correctable with a hearty pat on the back, an ‘atta-boy’ and glass of whole milk.

The Wizards suddenly got old, really old, in the offseason. Layered on top of old fashioned basketball philosophy, they are slowly getting left behind (even as the franchise advances past traditionally terrible to mediocre). Sayings like ‘You take what the defense gives you’ have hints of truth and validity, but such is also the symbolic flag-bearer for resistors unwilling to change or innovate or even experiment. It is the VHS video tape of basketball functionality, and the Washington Wizards still have a Blockbuster card in their billfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000151-5db9478c9978bef5d4d5b0f485264b75.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006705 00000000000 015062  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Image copyright Dulwich Picture Gallery Image caption The replica and the original of Fragonard's Young Woman will now hang side by side

The identity of a replica painting which was hung at Dulwich Picture Gallery as part of a "spot-the-fake" challenge has been revealed.

Since February, Jean-Honore Fragonard's 18th Century work Young Woman has been replaced by a $120 (£70) counterfeit, produced in China.

The public was asked whether it could identify the fake amongst the permanent collection of 270 Old Master paintings.

Nearly 3,000 visitors cast a vote, but only 10% guessed correctly.

The original will be put back in its frame on Tuesday and hung beside the replica, allowing people to compare the stylistic and material differences between the two.

Conceptual artist Doug Fishbone came up with the idea, selecting the original work and commissioning the copy from one of China's numerous exporters of handmade oil paintings.

The painting was made by the Meishing Oil Painting Manufacture Company, where 150 artists, many of them art students, make copies of well-known paintings - including Picasso, Matisse, Van Gogh and Monet - to order for clients across the world.

According to its website, the company "can reproduce various kinds of famous oil paintings in the world in enormous quantities such as impressionist, modern painting, scenery, seascape, still life, animal, pop art, abstract, classical, group paintings, reproduction oil painting, commerce oil painting, custom portrait oil painting and so on".

Strictly speaking, the works are not fakes, since the studio is careful to change the size slightly from the originals.

Attendance boost

Dulwich Picture Gallery was the first purpose-built public art gallery in England when it opened its doors in the south London suburb in 1811.

Chief curator Dr Xavier Bray said attendance had quadrupled during the last two months.

"Never before have I seen so many people actively looking at each painting," he said.

"Now Fragonard's portrait of a young woman has returned to the gallery walls and hangs alongside its modern companion. The visual exercise of comparing and contrasting will demonstrate how exciting it is to engage with an original work of art, but also marvel at the skill of a modern copyist working 5,000 miles away."

Speaking at the launch of the project, Fishbone said his experiment would raise questions about the nature and importance of an original work versus a replica.

"In the West, we see replicas as very problematic, as 'fakes' perhaps, whereas in China the notion of copying cultural artefacts is seen totally differently," he said.

Having seen the project through, he called visitors' responses "intriguing and eye-opening".

"I'm no conspiracy theorist, but if it leaves viewers with a healthy suspicion that what is presented to them may not be what it seems, and that our experiences can be manipulated in ways we are unaware of or cannot detect, it will have done something quite interesting."                                                           0000123-4b8f1908879a60ed4e45e900d2823e09.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004655 00000000000 014701  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        That’s right, party people. I went to Walgreens to pick up a prescription, and snagged them ALL. So rather than do 6 whole posts and review the trios and take up everyone’s time, I used one trio a day to create one giant review post!

What I love about these trios is that they are good for beginners, since the shadows are printed with the suggested usage of each. I followed the suggested usage just to make my reviews uniform.

As you can see, these colors aren’t particularly vivid. I’m still trying to warm myself up to matte pastel shadows and I wasn’t satisfied with how this one turned out. I did use primer but I feel like this trio may require a stronger base such as a solid white underneath to bring out the colors.

I’m loving these titles…if only I had realized 10 years ago that i was the It Girl….

It was wierd having two very light colors around this bold blue crease, but I definitely thought this looked better than the first one I tried! Also apparently the undereye concealer I used that day looks green in photographs…oops.

But which factory? I don’t get it. It must be a joke that goes over my head.

These colors are very tropical and summery but again, I wish they were bolder. I do like the combination though and will try this trio other ways in an attempt to get more out of it!

This is by and large the trio I was most excited to try. This is one of the classiest color combinations I know of and I was excited to see how it looked.

Success! Paired with the black and white striped top you can see (actually a body con dress) and a red highwaist pencil skirt and black and red pumps, this look was very retro/pinup glam and I LOVE it! I have done red and black eyes before so I can’t wait to try this in all different ways!

I certainly hope not. I still havent achieved life goal #1 of being a rock star.

This trio was more Spring than Summer to me, but I like it. The colors are very floral and I will hold onto it until then. This one I actually don’t mind how pale the colors are, it suits these particular shades well.

Ain’t that the truth.

This one got the most outside notice around the office. The color combination is fruity and great for summer.

Overall, I think the quality and variety is good for a drug store brand cosmetic. At 2.99 a trio, these were a good bargain and I would never have thought of some of these color combinations myself!

Have you tried any looks with these trios?

Cycling along the country roads of Flevoland, you can’t help but notice the wind. If you’re lucky, it is behind you, if it isn’t… well, good luck. It is no wonder that wind turbines haphazardly dot the landscape. They fit. This is the Netherlands, a country where wooden windmills have dotted the landscape for hundreds of years. Now instead of pumping water, modern wind turbines are now powering thousands of homes.

Stephan de Clerck and his brother Ralph live within a few kilometres of each other in Flevoland and they are no strangers to the wind. They have been harvesting wind energy for 11 years. In the beginning they were looking for ways to diversify their farms and incomes. They love how wind energy perfectly complements their other crops of potatoes, onions, and sugar beets. Once installed, the windmills turn steadily in the background, while the day-to-day life of a farmer continues. For them, wind energy is a valuable crop, and one that gets better the stormier the weather.









Together, Stephan and Ralph produce enough wind energy to power 5000 homes. Their energy is sold through WindUnie, a co-operative that sources and sells wind power to residents of the Netherlands. Twelve years ago, WindUnie was a small start-up, but through the engagement of landowners like Stephan and Ralph, this co-operative has grown to be a major player in the wind energy market in the Netherlands. Connecting residential customers with small-scale producers, the WindUnie website allows you to explore the suppliers of wind energy, meet their families and see where your wind is coming from. In the case of Stephan and Ralph, you find out that they have three and four children respectively and love skiing and walking on their holidays.

Stephan was very happy with the first set of wind turbines, so much so that he wanted to build more. But, by then, the zoning laws had changed and regulations were now requiring a minimum of six wind turbines to be built in a line rather than individually. Stephan realised that he couldn’t do it on his own. He knocked on the doors of his neighbours and together the five of them launched Samen voor de Wind, (Together for the Wind), a co-operative wind farm of seven turbines.

Samen voor de Wind has substantially contributed to the financial well-being and health of the families. All the members have young families and they are naturally happy to have the extra income. Furthermore, the co-operative has built a stronger community between the neighbours.

Stephan believes that for renewable energy to succeed, we desperately need to level the subsidy playing field. With the removal of fossil and nuclear fuel subsidies, the market would take over and clean energy would rise to top.

“In the future, instead of all of us being energy users, we will all become energy producers,” says Stephan.

Never ever allow a Bulldog to swim or be near a pool or water source when unattended. Even when with someone, keep a very close eye on him and keep him in your site always while around water. While CPR is a good option to use in drowning's, it still has low odds of survival in Bulldogs....and best to avoid getting into that sitaution in the first place!



Bulldogs don't swim and will die fast, in a matter of seconds. It's always a safe choice to use a life vest on your bulldog while your with him swimming or near a water source. His weight may prevent you from holding him up or rescue of him. A swimming life vest prevents that. If you have a pool, be sure it has a dog safe fence with self latching gates, just like you would have for a child.





2. Avoid heat. Bulldog will quickly die from exposure to hot tempatures , anything over 82 degrees is considered hot and caution should be used. That's with a healthy bulldog, if your dog has troubles breathing or health issues, that tempature is to high. Bathroom breaks and exercise is fine at up to 82 degrees for a healthy dog, just keep cool water available, know the signs of over heating and how to treat it and don't allow them to run and play hard when tempatures are hot, keep outside time limited to short periods of less than 30 minutes with shade.3. Avoid allowing your bulldog to GULP his food down, he should eat steadily and not to fast, in addition raw hide products should be avoided and small balls or any objects that can be a choking hazard should be avoided.4. Never allow your dog to run off leash when near traffic, streets or other animals and when out in the open in any area near a street.(NOTE:) Beware that bulldogs get stolen and caution should always be used as people will steal them from your own backyard, at a park, from your car and other ways.5. Avoid a vet that does not have experience with bulldogs. They are a special breed with special needs and can't be treated like any other dog. Use a Bulldog experienced vet.                                0000227-a9d82a3110a9f3c8863f59329f1bba5d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005113 00000000000 015101  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Vim working natively on Android phones

Introduction

I own a HTC Dream. While one may discuss about its usability as a phone, it makes a great portable internet access machine. I have installed a debian chroot on that machine and used to boot it when I wanted to edit some stuff on the go - it has vim, git, svn and anything else you may need. It was, however, tiring to enable it each and every time I wanted to edit something, and it used up some memory that only could be freed by rebooting.

So I've grabbed the NDK and built Vim for Android

Warning

This only works for rooted phones. I have only tested it on G1 a.k.a. HTC Dream.

Download

Grab this archive with Vim 7.3 for Android.

Install using computer and adb

adb push vim-android.tar.gz /sdcard adb shell # su # cd / # tar -zxf /sdcard/vim-android.tar.gz # ^D

After this step, you should have a vim binary in /data/local/bin/vim - the directory should be in your $PATH, but you can ensure by typing:

# echo $PATH

Install using your phone only

Connect to your phone's shell using ConnectBot, Better Terminal or other software. Then type as following:

$ su # cd / # wget -O - http://gdr.geekhood.net/gdrwpl/heavy/vim-android.tar.gz | tar -zxf -

Details

Vim is built using NDK. This means it doesn't link statically to libc or any libraries that are already present. The only library it has built-in is ncurses.

All vim-specific files are placed in /data/local/usr/share. It's equipped in syntax highlighting for vim and shell files and some scripts I found in Ubuntu's vim distribution. More scripts can be installed to /data/local/usr/share/vim. The default vimrc file can also be found in that directory. The package also has a terminfo database stolen from Ubuntu - it's needed for color display. It's placed in /data/local/usr/share/terminfo

The list of options can be viewed here: vim --version output. Mouse support is available if you apply my patch to ConnectBot (vote for its inclusion into mainline!)

The binary size is about 1.3 MB.

Source

Put the content of the source pack in the sources/ directory of Android NDK. Chdir to that directory and issue ndk-build to produce Vim binary in libs/armeabi/vim.

The actual sources are in jni/ directory. NCurses is to be found in jni/ncurses/

Vim's auto/config.h and other automatically generated files are generated by ./configure running on ubuntu and tweaked manually. Similar thing is done to ncurses' curses.priv.h.

Simply relacing the source files with newer vim and rebuilding should do the trick of upgrading to the latest version. Adding new files to Android.mk may also be needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0000049-ad2e39ed57438c4a8321ab3ec9aec1e6.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005150 00000000000 015316  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Gamers are getting older, and more of them are women than ever before.

Industry advocacy group the Entertainment Software Association, which operates the Electronic Entertainment Expo tradeshow and lobbies on behalf of publishers and developers, revealed a number of facts and figures about the gaming industry today. The report finds that 59 percent of Americans play games and that the average household in the U.S. has at least two gamers.

“People of all ages play video games,” Gains Through Gaming Lab co-director Jason Allaire said in regard to the report. “There is no longer a ‘stereotypical game player,’ but instead a game player could be your grandparent, your boss, or even your professor.”

The ESA’s report reflects that sentiment throughout.

The average age of someone who plays games is 31 years old. In fact, more gamers are over the age of 36 than between the ages of 18 to 35 or under the age of 18. They are also mostly men, but by a slimming margin. Men make up 52 percent. From 2012 to 2013, the number of women gamers over the age of 50 grew by 32 percent.

When it comes to how they play, most are still using a console. The average U.S. home owns at least one dedicated console, PC, or smartphone, but 68 percent of those that do use the console for gaming. That’s compared to 53 percent for smartphones.

Despite that disparity, smartphone use is up 22 percent from 2012 to 2013

Gamers are still buying more action games and shooters than anything else. The ESA finds that action makes up 31.9 percent while the gun-heavy titles make up another 20 percent. The rest of the pie chart splits between sports, role-playing, and a variety of other genres.

Of course, those are for premium-priced games that are for sale online or through retail. In terms of online games that people are playing the most (defined as most time spent playing), casual and social games take the top spot at 30 percent. That genre, which specializes in free-to-play mobile games, is up 55 percent from 2012. Puzzle, trivia, and card games make up another 28 percent. Clumped together below that is action, sports, strategy, and role-playing at 24 percent.

The ESA also reports that the total spending on games in the U.S. was $21.53 billion. That includes software, hardware, and accessories.

Finally, for the first time ever, digital spending on gaming outpaced physical retails sales in 2013. Digital games, which includes full downloads as well subscriptions and microtransactions, made up 53 percent of software revenue.

The ESA has a ton more data in its full report, which you can view below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000349-b4782ade985e882f99f2143e0eca6725.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004757 00000000000 015067  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Chicago, Illinois

The line to get into the Donald Trump rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) tonight was an indication of the chaos to come. Alongside Trump supporters in “Make America Great Again” baseball caps were anti-Trump protesters planning to disrupt the event, some wearing Bernie Sanders paraphernalia.

“We are going to make sure that all these racist Trump fans understand that we are not having this in Chicago,” said activist Ja’Mal Green, who was having trouble getting inside. “We got in this line and they were telling us ‘We are going to make America white again.’ We are not having this in Chicago. So we are going to go in there and be vocal and let the people know what’s going on.”

Inside the venue, the atmosphere was tense, with a large contingent of anti-Trump protesters gathered in a cluster in the middle of the arena. It appeared that a number of them were UIC students. Patrick Paniagua, a junior at UIC said he was part of a group of students who organized to try shut down the rally. He said he was protesting because he was Mexican-American, and had “a lot of family who is targeted by the hate of Trump.”

Periodic fights erupted between Trump supporters and protesters, with Illinois state police officers escorting the combatants outside. Trump’s rallies have been the scene of several violent incidents, including an event in North Carolina where a Trump supporter sucker-punched a protester and was later charged with assault.

In Chicago, the campaign first announced that the event would be postponed, but then decided to call off the rally altogether, with one organizer reading a statement saying that Trump “has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight’s rally will be postponed to another date.”

“Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace,” he added. The protesters erupted in cheers.

Arguments between protesters and Trump supporters continued outside the venue, where there were more anti-Trump protests taking place.

The protesters were jubilant; Trump supporters were angry and disappointed. Speaking on MSNBC, Trump said: “It’s a little bit sad when you can’t have a rally in a major city in this country … whatever happened to freedom of speech?”

“I think it’s horrible, they scammed their way in here. It’s un-American,” said Gina DiBalsamo, a Trump supporter. She called what happened “hate, extreme hate.”                 0000325-6519d302c16771f0f4a882d49afcb4bf.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007617 00000000000 015112  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Which countries are located on two continents?

In the world there are few countries that do not fall within the borders of one, but two continents.

This of course does not include countries like France, Great Britain, USA or Spain, which possess many islands and overseas territories on other continents.

Here, rather it comes to countries with more specific and often very strategic location.

Some countries in the list are well known, but others will be surprise for you.

Let’s take a look:

1. Russia

The largest country in the world is located on vast areas of Europe and Asia.

In cultural terms, Russia is a European country, although geographically the majority of the territory lies in Asia.

It is believed that if a country is situated on two continents it is crucial, on which continent is the capital and in this case the capital Moscow is located in Europe.

It is important to note however that this rule also has its exceptions.

2. Indonesia

Indonesia is located on the territory of thousands of islands.

Most of them are on the territory of Asia, but significant part of the island country is located within the boundaries of Oceania, to which belong Australia and New Zealand.

The largest Indonesian island that falls in Oceania is the island of New Guinea.

However, Indonesia is regarded as a typical Asian country and many people do not even suspect that significant part of the country is located in another geographic region.

3. Kazakhstan

Although Kazakhstan is a typical Asian country, a little known fact is that parts of its territory fall within the boundaries of the continent of Europe.

These are the western-most parts of the country which are located near by the coast of the Caspian Sea.

4. Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan is located mainly in Asia, but a small part of the country falls north of the Caucasus mountains and thus within Europe.

Despite the fact that the capital of Azerbaijan is in Asia and culturally the country is much closer to Asia, residents describe themselves as Europeans.

This is evidently in their currency notes, which depicts a map of Europe.

5. Georgia



Georgia is situated between Europe and Asia.

The reason is that part of its territory is located in the Caucasus mountains which play the role of a boundary between Europe and Asia.

However, Georgia is usually regarded as an Asian country.

6. Turkey



Turkey is one of the most popular countries situated on two continents.

Bosphorus, Marmara Sea and Dardanelles divide it into European and Asian parts.

The world multi-million metropolis Istanbul, which is the largest and most important Turkish city is located right on the border between Europe and Asia and is virtually built on two continents.

Giant bridges pass through the Bosphorus and connect both parts of this amazing city.

Moreover, Istanbul is considered to be the only city in the world, which is located within the borders of two continents.



This small Latin American country is known worldwide for its strategic location.

Panama Canal passes through its territory and connects the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean Sea.

This is one of the most important water ways in the world.

However, the canal separates North and South America.

Panama is located on both sides of the canal, that is to say on the both continents.

But the truth is different.

Given some geographical characteristics of Panama it is considered as a North American country.

Although Panama’s capital is indeed located on the continent of South America, most of its territory is located in North America.

8. Egypt

Egypt is perhaps the biggest surprise in this list.

With its pyramids, sandy desert and hot sun in the minds of most people Egypt has always been the embodiment of African country.

However, a small part of the territory is located within the borders of Asia.

The famous Sinai Peninsula lies east of the man made Suez Canal which plays the role of barrier between these two continents.                                                                                                                 0000184-376d1db2277404b2e1fbd78e897a1308.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006153 00000000000 014750  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        







For this meal I started off with one large potato, 2 medium carrots, and half a small onion. The root veggies were cut into 1/4" cubes and tossed with some butter, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. This all went into a foil packet, made by folding a piece of foil in half and then folding the edges over to close them. This packet was placed in a preheated 350* oven and a timer was set for 30 mins. Depending on how well you construct your pouch you may wanna put a pan under it, just in case there are any drips.









Next came 2 slices of bacon cut into 1/4" strips. The bacon is added to a cast iron pan, over medium heat, to start rendering out its fat and to crisp the pieces up.









While the bacon cooks, debone and remove the skin from 2 chicken leg quarters. Then cut the chicken into bite size pieces. Season liberally with your preferred seasoning mix (I used Montreal steak, a little bit of salt, and garlic powder on mine) and add it to the pan when your bacon is halfway cooked.

Move the bacon to one side of the pan and turn your heat up to medium high. Like most of my meats, I only want to flip the chicken once, so I try to make sure that I put the largest surface of each piece down in the pan. This also give me a nice amount of browning without overcooking or drying out the meat.

Once the chicken is browned on both sides, I added two handfuls of frozen broccoli, about 7oz. Not only does the little bit of ice on the broccoli create steam to help it cook, but it also deglazes the pan so you get all the flavor from the bacon and chicken in the broccoli too.









Check your broccoli for doneness after a few minutes and it should look something like this. A nice, bright green color and the broccoli shouldn't be mushy.













Cost Breakdown:





Chicken - 1.80lb @ $.89/lb = $1.60

Broccoli - 7oz @ $1.50 for 14 oz = $.75

Bacon - .25lb @ $.50/lb = $.44

Butter - 3T @ $2.50/lb = $.32

Carrots - 5oz @ 1.70 for 2lb = $.25

Potato - .5lb @ 5lbs for $2.50 = $.25

Onion - 2oz @ 6lb for $4.00 = $.08





Total = $3.69

if you divide that by 2.5 servings it's only $1.47 per serving!!









Here's the finished dish. This recipe made enough for me to have a second helping and still have enough left over for another meal. Cheap, easy, and delicious, what more can you ask for? Hope you enjoyed reading and please don't forget to comment and share!!









My 30min alarm was going off around this time so I turned off the oven, but left the pouch in there. You really don't have to worry about anything in there burning so you can just let them stay warm in the oven.Throw a lid on it and let the steam finish it off. With a cast iron pan like this there is plenty of heat left in the pan to finish cooking the broccoli, so I turned my stove off.Now that, the stuff in the pan is done, we can turn our attention to the packet of goodies in the oven. Carefully remove it from the oven, to a plate or cutting board. Unfold one of the seams and pull the pouch open. Watch out for all that delicious smelling steam, it's HOT! I like to serve it with a little more butter on top and a little more salt and fresh ground pepper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0000212-634da8ef10ad1d73ede841aa0ecb6bfe.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011416 00000000000 015516  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Last night I watched the second half of Question Time and then This Week. Midway through this week I began to realise how little political to-ing and fro-ing means to me any longer. I tweeted that maybe I was seeing politics and politicians in a similar way to the general public for the first time. I suppose it’s been a process that has been going on for two years, ever since I decided to abandon any future attempts to get into Parliament.

I think doing my LBC show has also been an influence. Watching Question Time I wanted to throw something at the screen. And it wasn’t just Ben Bradshaw’s constant hypocrisy that got me going. The journalist, Angela Epstein, who I can’t say had ever come across my radar before, was just vacuous in the extreme. Nothing worth saying at all. Ian Hislop did his usual playing to the audience, Anna Soubry was just plain irritating, constantly appearing to talk down to the audience without actually meaning to, and Ming Campbell did his best to be above the fray but it didn’t quite work. But the reason this programme has gone down hill is that its host, David Dimbleby seems increasingly to think the programme is all about him. It isn’t. And his constant attempts to mirror a tabloid journalist and paint all politicians in a negative light are becoming just plain tiresome.

This Week wasn’t much better. Alan Johnson spent the whole programme trying to avoid taking a position on anything. He ought to be reminded that’s what he’s there to do. Portillo sat there loftily, talking down to us and subliminally assuring us that he knows best about everything. Even when his powers of prediction were exposed as risible by Andrew Neil, he didn’t even have the good grace to admit he had been totally wrong. He just sneered at Cameron, as he usually does. Neil Hamilton’s film was risible and the ensuing debate with Shirley Williams was mind numbing.

Laura Kuenssberg was the only bright spot in 45 minutes of utter tedium. At the end of it, I just thought to myself that maybe the reason I grew so irritated by both programmes was because I just don’t appreciate politics in the way that I used to. Maybe others in the Westminster Village still think these programmes rule the political roost and are captivated by them. I no longer am. But it’s not just them. I watch PMQs and I find the level of debate, if you can call it that, embarrassing. I watch political interviews with cabinet and shadow cabinet ministers and despair of the vacuity of the questions and answers. Perhaps I now understand what most voters think of the same things.

It’s also the standard of political journalism and comment that turns me off. Take this morning’s comments about the fact that David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson spent some of last night in a Swiss pizza restaurant. Here’s the Mirror’s James Lyons…

And there were plenty more like that. Are people seriously saying that politicians should hide themselves away in their hotel rooms? I suppose James Lyons would have then made a fuss about the room service bill. Just imagine if they had been out in a posh Davos restaurant.

Our public life is being corrupted by a permanent sneer and cynical outlook by those who report on it. Yes, to some extent it’s the fault of those who serve in public life. The trouble is that the way politics is now reported in the print and broadcast media, it’s a wonder anyone wants to go into it. And this is why increasingly we will get a political class made up of geeks and obsessives. Normal people, people who actually want to do good, will turn their efforts elsewhere, and who can blame them?

I look at some of my friends who got elected in 2010 and wonder what’s happened to them. Several of them are so far up their own arses that they don’t even bother to reply to text messages any longer. Now that one or two have becomes ministers they’re so very important (at least in their own eyes) that they forget about those who helped them get there.

I remarked to someone a few weeks ago that in 25 years of being involved in politics, I could probably count on the fingers of two hands the number of real friends I have made in the political arena. That perhaps says just as much about me as it does others, but It just shows how transient political relationships can be. People befriend you when they think you can be useful to them. As soon as you can’t, they drop you like a stone. Perhaps I have done it myself. I’d like to think not, but I can’t look myself in the mirror and say it categorically hasn’t happened.

Politics is like a drug. It’s very difficult to pull yourself away from something which is capable of giving you the equivalent of a massive adrenaline rush. I suspect I will never lose an interest in politics. But I know now that I am falling out of love with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0000308-abf76a6802949f2c8bf9693fcd4ab000.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007134 00000000000 015171  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The lucky recipient in the classic Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas" got 23 birds over the course of the holiday season.

Hopefully they didn’t live in a studio apartment.

In the yuletide spirit, we’re taking a closer look at the birds immortalized in the English folk song, first published around 1780.

Seven Swans A-Swimming

There are eight species of swans worldwide, and the most common species in England is the mute swan. The classy birds, inspirations for European fariytales, are popular exports and are often seen a-swimming in park lakes in North America.

Generally “swans mate for life," and couples have an endearing "habit of swimming side-by-side," says J.V. Remsen, curator of birds at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science. (Watch a mute swan "windsurf" across a lake.)

Six Geese A-Laying

It's unknown which geese the song refers to, although several species live in England, including pink-footed geese, barnacle geese, and Canada geese, a non-native species introduced from the U.S.

Noisy by nature, and with amazing eyesight and hearing, domestic geese have been trained to guard police stations in China. (Related: "Honk if You Think Geese Are Good Guard Dogs.")

Four Colly Birds

Though most of us sing “four calling birds,” the correct word is actually "colly," according to a 2016 blog post by the Library of Congress.

The word colly is an Old English adjective used to describe something black, like coal. So colly birds likely refer to blackbirds, according to the library. Twenty more and you’ve got a pie.

There is, however, a caveat for those of us in North America, Donald Kroodsma, retired ornithologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, says via email.

"The blackbird of English literature is a close relative of our robin,” which are both part of the thrush family, Kroodsma says, whereas North American blackbirds are part of the icterid family.

And if you prefer calling birds, we asked Kroodsma, author of Listening to a Continent Sing: Birdsong By Bicycle From the Atlantic to the Pacific to choose a favorite.

“What's sweeter than a cardinal song?” he says.

Three French Hens

Most of the birds mentioned in the song are wild species, except for the French hen, "which is probably a breed of chicken and hence not wild,” says Kathi Borgmann, an ornithologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

The song may refer to the Favorelles chicken, a breed named for the region in France from which they originated in the late 1800s. These large, colorful birds have feathery ear muffs and beards—even the females have beards.

Must be hipster chicks.

Two Turtle Doves

The European turtle dove, a beautiful bird with pink and chestnut colors, is in no way related to turtles, quips Remsen.

Their scientific name is Streptopelia turtur—the latter of which means "turtle" in Latin. “So this is truly a curious situation.”

Some people believe their reptilian name comes from their call, which makes a "turr, turr" sound.

A Partridge in a Pear Tree

Possibly the most famous avian in the Christmas diddy is the partridge.

To most, a partridge probably brings to mind something like the plump little chukar, a partridge native to Eurasia and introduced to North America as a game bird.

There are 92 known species of partridges, which are relatives of quail and live in grasslands the world over.

Sadly, though, the birds are ground nesters, and not "likely to roost in pear trees," says Michael Ward, avian ecologist at the University of Illinois. (See the world's most unusual Christmas trees.)

Next thing they'll be telling us reindeer don't get air miles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0000322-4a2a032e503723be3e25dfebc816d3ff.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015303 00000000000 015215  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Ecstasy is the street name for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, an illicit party drug that speeds up messages to and from the brain and alters the user’s perception of reality. Other street names include eckies, E, XTC, pills, pingers and molly.

Pills sold as ecstasy contain variable amounts of MDMA, sometimes none, and may also include other fillers. The pills come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours, and often have designs stamped on them such as rabbits, hearts and smiley faces.

While pills are the most common form of ecstasy, it is also sold as powder and, more recently (and rarely), in a crystal form. All forms are typically swallowed, but are sometimes crushed and snorted, injected or smoked.

Ecstasy costs around A$25 per tablet, ranging from A$20 in South Australia to A$40 in the Northern Territory. A capsule sells for around A$30. Powder and crystal sell for around A$250 and A$260 per gram.

MDMA is illegal in Australia, which means possession, use, manufacture and trafficking are criminal offences. The threshold for drug trafficking in Australia ranges from half a gram in the NT to ten grams in Tasmania.

History

MDMA was first manufactured in Germany in the early 1900s as a precursor chemical for a pharmaceutical drug to stop bleeding. It was not considered significant at the time and only appears to be patented as part of the synthesis process.

It was not until much later (in 1927 and 1959) that the basic pharmacology of MDMA was tested, but not in humans.

In the 1960s, Alex Shulgin, sometimes referred to as the “Godfather of ecstasy”, rediscovered it and created a new and easier way to make the drug, which he personally tested along with many other psychedelic compounds he created.

It was used in the 1970s and early 80s for a range of experimental therapeutic purposes, including in psychotherapy for couples. MDMA is in the early stages of being tested for safety as a possible treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in conjunction with psychotherapy, but there are no currently endorsed therapeutic uses of MDMA.

The idea behind using MDMA to treat PTSD is that people with this disorder often avoid their emotions and MDMA may be able to assist them to be more expressive during psychotherapy.

In the mid to late 1980s, ecstasy became a dance party favourite in Australia and other parts of the world.

Effects of ecstasy

MDMA is an amphetamine-type stimulant, with hallucinogenic effects.

MDMA’s main effects are through the release of serotonin, unlike its cousins the amphetamines, which work mainly through the dopamine system. Too little serotonin and dopamine are both associated with depression.

Serotonin helps regulate mood, sexual desire and sexual function, as well as other bodily processes such as appetite, sleep and temperature. MDMA releases large amounts of serotonin artificially, increasing the effects of serotonin in the brain, such as significantly improved mood.

People who use ecstasy report a range of positive effects including increased confidence, well-being, happiness, empathy and sex drive. MDMA enhances social behaviour and empathy towards others.

Some of the less desirable effects include nausea, jaw clenching, and increased heart rate and blood pressure.

Who uses ecstasy?

Australians are the biggest users of ecstasy in the world, with 3% of the population reporting they have used it at least once in the last year.

Ecstasy is mostly used relatively infrequently by recreational drug users at dance parties, music festivals and social events. Even among people who regularly use ecstasy, the average frequency of use is less than twice a month.

It is most commonly used by people in their 20s – around 9% of that age group have used in the past year. The average age that people first try ecstasy is around 22 years.

Very few people report use by the time they are in their 40s (only around 0.5%).

Men use ecstasy at nearly twice the rate as women.

Although the number of detections and seizures of the drug increased by nearly 330%, and the weight of those seizures by over 1,100%, between 2011 and 2013, there was no reported increase in the rate of use.

But the best available population data suggests a relatively high proportion of new users.

How dangerous is ecstasy?

Unlike other stimulants, MDMA does not appear to be at high risk of overuse because the positive effects decrease and negative effects increase quickly with use. It has been described as a “self-limiting” drug, with most people using irregularly, for a relatively short period of time.

Dependence is uncommon and the proportion of people presenting to treatment centres for ecstasy as a primary drug of concern is very low at about 1% of cases.

Animal studies show changes to brain chemistry, especially in the serotonin system, after long-term use of MDMA.

Cognitive deficits in mice include learning and memory problems. But this does not seem to translate consistently to major cognitive problems in humans if they primarily only use ecstasy.

There is some limited evidence that long-term use of ecstasy, particularly by adolescents, may increase vulnerability to mental health problems.

While long-term problems with the drug are rare, acute harms due to toxicity and overdose are more common, and may be on the rise. Serotonin syndrome can occur as a result of the release of stored serotonin and may result in a range of symptoms including confusion, loss of coordination, increased heart rate and agitation.

Releasing large amounts of serotonin can also deplete natural levels in the brain resulting in feeling flat and unmotivated the next day after taking MDMA.

Media have reported large numbers of overdoses, including deaths, at festivals around the country over summer.

Ambulance callouts for ecstasy in Victoria increased by around 10% between 2013 and 2014. Although they still remain the fourth lowest of all illicit drugs.

One of the main dangers of pills sold as ecstasy is the unknown contents. In addition, the relatively large proportion of first-time users may be at higher risk of problems because they are unfamiliar with the drug, its effects and the risks.

Often pills sold as ecstasy are a combination of other stimulants, hallucinogens and various other drugs, increasing the risk of adverse reactions and toxicity.

One of the common substitute drugs is paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), which is significantly more toxic than MDMA. It is up to ten times more potent; it works more slowly so people sometimes take a second dose thinking the first hasn’t worked; and it is more likely to increase serotonin in the brain to toxic levels.

In an article in the prestigious journal Lancet, researchers ranked 20 common legal and illegal drugs by their potential for harm. Ecstasy ranked third lowest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000050-a598a504d83cfb6121496c4d7865db1b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004243 00000000000 015020  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Freddie Sears (right) and Brett Pitman (left) scored Ipswich's goals

Freddie Sears scored in the opening 16 seconds as Ipswich made it seven games without a win for Fulham.

The visitors took an early lead in the Championship game when Sears ran at Fulham's defence from the kick-off and fired home from the edge of the box.

The Cottagers were level when Ross McCormack struck a fantastic 30-yard free-kick into the bottom-left corner.

But Ipswich scored the winner in the second half when Brett Pitman steered home Sears' cross.

Town remain sixth in the table, with Fulham - the top scorers in the division with 34 goals despite being held scoreless on Tuesday night - staying 17th.

It was the second game in charge for Cottagers senior coach Stuart Gray, after their 2-2 draw with Brentford, as the club continue to look for a new manager following Kit Symons' departure in November.

Fulham had chances to level with substitute Matt Smith heading just wide, but at the other end Sears put a shot just wide for Ipswich.

After that chance, the hosts never looked like forcing a late equaliser.

Fulham senior coach Stuart Gray: "We can't control the decision upstairs. Our focus is on winning games. I can't fault the players' application. At the moment nothing has been said. I will be preparing the players until told otherwise.

"What has been happening at this club far too often this season is going a goal down. You don't expect to concede after 16 seconds.

"We need to work hard on the training ground. The players know they let themselves down."

Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy: "Brett deserves all the credit as he has not trained since Saturday. He's had root canal treatment and travelled on the bus with a splitting headache and toothache. He's had difficulty sleeping but he epitomised my team's performance with the way he went about things.

"It was a great away performance. We played very well, deserved to win but we let them off the hook a bit.

It’s the uplifting ends of the American Dream. It’s the way to get women.

No matter its versatile purpose, money makes things happen. Especially when it comes to politics. Lately, that seems particularly true with politics and beer.

It took three years for Florida to pass a growler law. It took millions to convince Stone to come to Virginia. It’s turned into a digital battle for attention in North Carolina.

Money can be a lot of things, but there’s no denying one of its unifying forces: power.

Over the next week, I plan to share a compilation of data sourced from public record for major beer companies and organizations who all play a role in shaping the politics of beer, whether that’s lobbying for laws or throwing support behind them. Money, power and influence are all at work for the beer industry, just like so many others who extend their fingertips and dollars into Washington, D.C.

In the 4th Quarter of 2014, $2.1 million was spent on lobbying efforts by just a handful of beer companies and organizations, from trade groups like the Beer Institute and Brewers Association, which hired its first full-time lobbyist this year, to behemoth Anheuser-Busch.

Here’s how that money was spent, with figures sourced from the U.S. House Office of the Clerk:

Spending among these groups got even stronger in the 1st Quarter of 2015, totaling a little over $2.6 million combined:

Why spend all this money?

I turned to a full-time D.C. lobbyist to provide some context. Please note to avoid conflicts with their employer, who isn’t part of the beer industry, I agreed to not disclose the lobbyist’s name. You can read their short explainer on lobbying here.

“Lobbying isn’t just attempting to get Congress to pass bills that would benefit a company, for example, it’s also used to stop bills from passing, repeal old laws, and to just educate members of Congress on the important work a group does,” they said.

Perhaps the biggest national issue related to the beer industry these days is a pair of competing bills aimed at providing tax breaks to breweries known as the Small BREW Act and the Fair BEER Act.

In a very plain, basic way, the Small BREW Act is geared to address breweries producing less than 6 million barrels of beer a year, which in layman’s terms would often be the ones known as “craft” by beer drinkers. The BEER Act would benefit all brewers, including Big Boys like Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors and Heineken. For an easy-to-understand rundown of these pieces of legislation, I suggest this post, however please note the graphic is provided by the Brewers Association.

With all that in mind, we’ll put on our walking shoes and follow the money starting tomorrow:

Editor’s note: My goal with this series isn’t to editorialize the behaviors or spending patterns of these groups, but provide context and information with which you might not be familiar. I welcome discussion and debate in comments, but know I’m not trying to endorse Democrats or Republicans, Big Business or Small Business, etc.

Thanks to Scott Janish for data used in the above charts.

After meeting with the president of Zuckerberg's lobbying group, Miller says, "FWD.us is employing questionable lobbying techniques, misleading supporters, and not being transparent about the underlying values and long-term intentions of the organization."

Miller's particularly let down because he thinks that Zuckerberg, and the technology people he's trying to get onboard with FWD.us shouldn't resort to the same-old lobbying tactics. He wants to see something truly progressive and unique.

Here's his breakdown of how it will work:

FWD.us' lobbying strategy, though pitched as "pragmatic" and "smart" by Beltway insiders, is typically only practiced by large pharmaceutical companies, gun manufacturers, and the like. It works like this: You approach key representatives who are on the fence about voting for comprehensive legislative reform and finance advertisements that portray their stance on any other issue of their choosing. In other words, FWD.us effectively bribes politicians by saying, "Vote with us on this controversial issue, and we'll remind your constituents why you're great on some other issue they care about — any issue." Thus, the Keystone XL debacle was not an accident — it's the strategy. Supporters of this lobbying technique defend it by saying, "It's the way Washington works." But given that Mark Zuckerberg and the other technology pioneers who are behind FWD.us have risen to prominence by spearheading disruptive innovations, reverting to such traditional lobbying tactics seems like a missed opportunity for meaningful change. Technology companies live and die by how innovative their products are, our organizing and lobbying tactics should be no different.

The collaborative agreement is with the English River First Nation, a band of more than 1,000 people who live on seven small reserves in the province's northwest. Another 400 people live off-reserve.

"This introduces a level of stability and predictability around employment, business training and community investment and environmental stewardship," Cameco vice-president Gary Merasty said Thursday.

"This is a little more certainty around project development. If there is a lawsuit hanging over, you know that introduces a level of risk to the project."

A formal signing ceremony is to be held Friday in the community of Patuanak, about 600 kilometres north of Saskatoon.

Most of the money is to flow to the First Nation over 10 years through contracts with band-owned businesses and wages to band members, who are expected to work at the mines and on community development projects.

There are also to be direct payments to the community for education, health, sports and recreation programs.

English River vice-chief Marie Black said the deal will help the Dene band become more self-sufficient and less reliant on the federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.

"It is very, very important that we go ahead and work with industry. This is for jobs," Black said.

Some English River members are worried about the environmental consequences of more uranium mining in the area. They say a decision on the deal was made by band council without a community vote.

The agreement states the deal will be worth significantly more to the band beyond 10 years, including if Cameco Corp.'s (TSX:COO) Millennium project goes ahead.

The proposed underground mine, which still requires environmental approval, is estimated to contain more than 50 million pounds of uranium.

Saskatoon-based Cameco, the largest uranium producer in the world, plans to submit its final environmental impact application for Millennium to regulators later this year.

Last June, Cameco purchased Areva Resources Canada Inc.'s 28 per cent interest in the Millennium project for $150 million.

Areva is the world's second-largest uranium producer.

Both corporations have uranium mines in northern Saskatchewan.

The agreement says the First Nation agrees to drop a lawsuit it filed in 2008 against the Saskatchewan government over land the band claimed under the 1992 Treaty Land Entitlement Framework.

"The lands in question included those on which Cameco hopes to develop its Millennium project," reads the deal.

"English River First Nation has decided that based on the substantial benefits and commitments it has negotiated under the collaboration agreement, it is in their best interest to agree under the terms to discontinue the ... lawsuit so as to help ensure the timely development of the Millennium project."

Candyce Paul, who works as a teaching assistant at La Plonge reserve, said some people are concerned and want more information on how increased uranium mining will affect human health, wildlife and the land.

Many people supported the court case and haven't been given enough of an explanation about why it is being dropped, she said.

There are also questions about how many jobs will be created and who will get them.

Paul said a "trickle-down" approach could mean that some people won't be better off under the agreement.

"The benefits they are talking about are all financial, but the cultural devastation and the environmental devastation is what the people are concerned about," she said.

"They will clean out our area and leave a mess. This is temporary money."

Cameco said one of the benefits of the agreement is that it will help people and businesses develop skills and experience they can use well into the future.

The corporation said its environmental footprint in northern Saskatchewan is tiny and once its mines stop producing the sites will be fully decommissioned.

Japan's JCU Exploration Co. has a 30.1 per cent stake in Millennium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000380-43dd6209af70734e0e2e3ffd21387466.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007521 00000000000 014747  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Your brain is an organ of two halves – the left side and the right side. And there are many brain functions, such as language skills or which hand you write with, which are organised mostly in one side of the brain or the other.

Simple behavioural tests have now allowed us to see how this organisation is revealed through biases in how we see and interact with the world – and each other – often without us being aware of it.

Examining how people perceive a diagram of variously orientated lines and angles provided clues that people typically have a subconscious bias for seeing things set out in clockwise orientations.

We then realised that this might also be related to a number of physical instincts that people have, such as which way they turn their heads. After looking at recent research in visual psychophysics and visual neuroscience, we saw various perceptual and behavioral phenomena in which humans can have a directional bias.

Many of these turning behaviours are seen early in life. For example, infants have an initial bias for turning the head to the right (and consequently extending the left arm outward to compensate for that movement).

Some previous research found that such an instinctive turn to the right extends to adulthood – when an adult kisses another on the lips, their heads tend to automatically lean to the right. But is this an extension of the bias that humans are born with, or do people simply learn to kiss that way?

In Western societies it is commonplace to see people kiss in public, on television, and in films. But are these screen kisses reflecting society, or do they influence how people behave? The prior research on the subject was all conducted with kissing in what are known as “W.E.I.R.D.” – Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic – societies. So the conclusions might not reflect what humans naturally do in the absence of learning through observation.

Bangladesh seemed like an interesting non-W.E.I.R.D. country to examine this. It is a conservative Muslim country where kissing is prohibited in public, and even censored from television or films. So, whereas similar results from the W.E.I.R.D. countries could be attributed to social learning or socio-cultural factors, the same cannot as easily be said in Bangladesh.

In our study, we asked a number of married couples in Bangladesh to kiss privately in their own homes. They then went into separate rooms to report on various aspects of the kiss independently of each partner.

A kiss is still a kiss

The results showed that more than two thirds of the kissing individuals had a bias for turning their heads to the right. When initiating a kissing “move” (men were 15 times more likely to initiate the kiss) right-handed people leaned right and left-handed people leaned left.

The person being kissed, regardless of whether they were left or right handed, responded by matching the partners’ head leaning direction. It felt awkward to go the other way as reported by most of the kiss recipients and kiss initiators in our study.

It turns out that humans are similar, even if our social values, and the habits we are exposed to, differ. This bias in the act of kissing is likely innate and determined by the brain splitting up tasks to its different hemispheres, similar to being either right- or left-handed. It is perhaps specifically concerned with the functions in the left cerebral hemisphere, located in the emotion and decision-related areas of the brain.

Different hormone levels (such as testosterone) in each hemisphere and neurotransmitters might be unevenly distributed to each hemisphere (such as dopamine, involved in reward behaviours) and give rise to a bias to turn right.

If you do lean in for a kiss to the left, you may be in the minority. But don’t worry – if the person you are kissing wants to be kissed, they will likely go left, too.                                                                                                                                                                               0000324-98b51420d61d1b69eb46d812ededca5d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001450 00000000000 015232  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The variation has been found in farm animals and humans on the Continent, causing serious heart, bone, blood and skin diseases, as well as pneumonia.

Dr Giles Edwards, the director of the Scottish MRSA Reference Laboratory, said three people in Scotland had contracted the strain, known as ST398, in recent months.

"A lot of the patients who got this infection in Holland and Canada have been people who work with animals, such as farmers and vets. But none of the three individuals in Scotland have been in contact with animals, not that we could find."

All three patients have recovered, he added.

The Soil Association, the organic food charity, called on the Government to step up its testing for farm animals, pointing out that this strain is just as deadly and infectious as that found in hospitals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000336-89670e96db15f6b44395955a50d0c869.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000022462 00000000000 014640  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Royal Mail Ship wrecked off Salt Island in the British Virgin Islands in a hurricane

RMS Rhone was a UK Royal Mail Ship owned by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company (RMSP). She was wrecked off the coast of Salt Island in the British Virgin Islands on 29 October 1867 in a hurricane, killing 123 people. She is now a popular Caribbean wreck dive site.[4]

History [ edit ]

Rhone RMS

RMSP ships carried mail, passengers, horses, and cargo on regular scheduled routes. Its first services had been between Southampton and the Caribbean, but in 1851 it added a new route between Southampton and Rio de Janeiro. This growing trade, and a number of ships lost at sea, created a need for new ships.

In June 1863 RMSP ordered Rhone from the Millwall Iron Works on the Isle of Dogs, London and her sister ship Douro from Caird & Company in Greenock. The pair was initially to work the Rio de Janeiro route. They were similar but not identical. Both were handsome ships, but Rhone was considered to have slightly finer lines.

At this time the Admiralty supervised Royal Mail Ship contracts. During building the Admiralty surveyor criticised Rhone's bulkheads and water tight compartments. Revisions were made, and the ship was completed to the surveyor's satisfaction.

Rhone had an iron hull, was 310 feet (94 m) long, had a 40-foot (12 m) beam and 2,738 GRT. She was a sail-steamer, rigged as a two-masted brig. Her compound steam engine developed 500 NHP and gave her a speed of 14 knots (26 km/h) on her sea trials. In her contract the ship cost £25 17s 8d per ton and her engine cost £24,500.

Rhone was an innovative ship. She had a bronze propeller, which was only the second ever made of this alloy.[citation needed] She had also a surface condenser in order to save and re-use water in her boilers and steam engine. She was the first ship so equipped to visit Brazil, so in port in 1865 the Emperor of Brazil, Pedro II, came aboard and visited her engine room to see it.

Rhone's passenger capacity was 253 first class, 30 second class and 30 third class. On 9 October 1865 she left Southampton on her maiden voyage to Brazil. At first she suffered from overheated bearings, but once this was resolved she became a fast and reliable ship. Her next five voyages were also to Brazil.

Rhone proved her worth by weathering several severe storms. One storm in 1866 destroyed the cutter and two lifeboats on her port side, damaged the cutter and the mail boat on her starboard side, damaged much of her deck furniture, killed two horses and broke one sailor's leg.

In January 1867 Rhone made her final voyage to Brazil, after which RMSP transferred her to the Caribbean route, which at the time was more lucrative and prestigious.

Sinking [ edit ]

Rhone ' s wreck in the Position ofs wreck in the British Virgin Islands

On 19 October 1867 Rhone drew alongside RMS Conway in Great Harbour, Peter Island for bunkering. The original coaling station they needed had been moved from the then Danish island of St. Thomas due to an outbreak of yellow fever.

On the day of the sinking, Rhone's Master, Frederick Woolley,[9] was slightly worried by the dropping barometer and darkening clouds, but because it was October and hurricane season was thought to be over, Rhone and Conway stayed in Great Harbour. The storm which subsequently hit was later known as the San Narciso Hurricane and retrospectively categorised as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The first half of the storm passed without much event or damage, but the ferocity of the storm worried the captains of Conway and Rhone, as their anchors had dragged and they worried that when the storm came back after the eye of the storm had passed over, they would be driven onto the shore of Peter Island.

They decided to transfer the passengers from Conway to the "unsinkable" Rhone; Conway was then to head for Road Harbour and Rhone would make for open sea. As was normal practice at the time, the passengers in Rhone were tied into their beds to prevent them being injured in the stormy seas.

Conway got away before Rhone but was caught by the tail end of the storm, and eventually foundered off the south side of Tortola.[10] But Rhone struggled to get free as her anchor was caught fast. It was ordered to be cut loose, and lies in Great Harbour to this day, with its chain wrapped around the same coral head that trapped it a century and a half ago. Time was now critical, and Captain Woolley decided that it would be best to try to escape to the shelter of open sea by the easiest route, between Black Rock Point of Salt Island and Dead Chest Island. Between those two islands lay Blonde Rock, an underwater reef which was normally a safe depth of 25 feet (7.6 m), but during hurricane swells, there was a risk that Rhone might founder on that. The Captain took a conservative course, giving Blonde Rock (which cannot be seen from the surface) a wide berth.

However, just as Rhone was passing Black Rock Point, less than 250 yards (230 m) from safety, the second half of the hurricane came around from the south. The winds shifted to the opposite direction and Rhone was thrown directly into Black Rock Point. It is said that the initial lurch of the crash sent Captain Woolley overboard, never to be seen again. Local legend says that his teaspoon can still be seen lodged into the wreck itself. Whether or not it is his, a teaspoon is clearly visible entrenched in the wreck's coral. The ship broke in two, and cold seawater made contact with her hot boilers which had been running at full steam, causing them to explode.

The ship sank swiftly, the bow section in 80 feet (24 m) of water, the stern in 30 feet (9 m). Of the approximately 145 crew and passengers on board, twenty-five people survived the wreck.[11] The bodies of many of the sailors were buried in a nearby cemetery on Salt Island. Due to her mast sticking out of the water, and her shallow depth, she was deemed a hazard by the Royal Navy in the 1950s and her stern section was blown up.

As dive site [ edit ]

Rhone is now a popular dive site, and the area around her was turned into a national park in 1980.[12]

Rhone has received a number of citations and awards over the years as one of the top recreational wreck dives in the Caribbean, both for its historical interest and teeming marine life, and also because of the open and relatively safe nature of the wreckage. Very little of the wreckage is still enclosed, and where overhead environments do exist, they are large and roomy and have openings at either end permitting a swim through, so there is no real penetration diving for which divers usually undergo advanced training.

Her bow section is still relatively intact, and although the wooden decks have rotted away, she still provides an excellent swim-through for divers. Her entire iron hull is encrusted with coral and overrun by fishes (and the local barracuda named Fang), and the cracks and crevices of her wreckage provide excellent habitats for lobsters, eels, and octopuses. Her wreckage was also featured in the 1977 filming of The Deep, including a scene of Jacqueline Bisset diving in a T-shirt.

The wreck has been well treated over the years. There used to be a full set of wrenches (spanners), still visible on the deep part (each wrench being about 4 feet (1.2 m) long and weighing over 100 pounds (45 kg)). In recent decades the largest of these were stolen by a collector, leaving only the smaller wrenches. Also remaining are a few brass portholes and even a silver teaspoon. The remaining wrenches are under 55 feet (17 m) of water. Similarly the wreck features the "lucky porthole", a brass porthole in the stern section which survived the storm intact and remains shiny by divers rubbing it for good luck. This porthole is considered "lucky" because the glass still survives. For many years a popular resident of the wreck was a 500-pound (230 kg) Goliath grouper also known as a Jew fish, but two ex-pat fishermen with spear guns killed it despite spear guns being illegal for non-nationals and the area being a national park. Today the wreck is visited by hundreds of tourists every day, most of whom are more circumspect in their treatment of the site.

The wreck's maximum depth is 85 feet (26 m) of water.

The Rhone National Park was closed for a short time from 29 August 2011 because the container ship Tropical Sun had run aground on rocks near Salt Island very near the wreck.[13]

Launch-on-demand: Ideally, a small fleet of these space planes would be available for immediate launch, backed by a supply of specialized small satellites that could be pulled off the shelf and loaded into the space plane to perform critical missions. The ultimate would be having these vehicles in an ?alert? status, similar to how fighters and bombers sat alert, during the Cold War, ready to deploy at-will.

Surprise factor: On the first orbit, a space plane could capture data, before the ?target? knew it was coming. Not as predictable as a satellite?s orbit - at least on the first pass.

Flexibility: A space plane could be launched into any orbit, at any inclination, providing prompt ?eyes-on? of virtually any area of the world. Altitude could be varied, as well. A space plane might also be used in a sub-orbital ?arc? flight profile, perform its duties, then be recovered at a remote air field half-way around the globe.

?Ultimately, weapons couldbe delivered from a spaceplane in low Earth orbit,? Scott said, citing a ?Rods from God? scenario.That idea is akin to a lawn-dart weapon idea that uses tungsten rods lobbedfrom space to hit a cross-haired target on the ground.

?I did a story aboutthe rods concept in 1994 or 1995, based on concepts being discussed in the U.S.Air Force at the time,? Scott said. ?Fifteen years later, maybe they?re readyfor testing.?

Tactical advantage

Viewingthe X-37B as a fascinating project, and one that fuels speculation is EverettDolman, Professor of Comparative Military Studies at the School of Advanced Airand Space Studies at the Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama.

?Itis not possible to tell yet whether the program is an example of the output ofbureaucratic inertia or the beginning of something much bigger, Dolman advised.

Thevalue of a true space plane to military thinkers and planners has long been evident,Dolman suggested, from thoughts in the early 1900s to the original grandvisions for the space shuttle. Fast forward to today, in the case of the X-37B,while none of the planned missions for the space plane are public as of yet, hecontinued, a few of the potential missions are easy to conjure up.

?Regardlessof its original intent, the most obvious and formidable is in service as aspace fighter - a remotely piloted craft capable of disabling multiplesatellites in orbit on a single mission and staying on orbit for months toengage newly orbited platforms,? Dolman said. That capability ?would be atremendous tactical advantage.?

Furthermore,the small size of the X-37B, coupled with maneuverability on orbit would makeit almost impossible for non U.S. space watchers to keep an eye on itswhereabouts, Dolman said.

Testplatform for what?

Evenif it were not used to engage and disable satellites, Dolman said, it could bemaneuvered up close and personal to inspect orbiting satellites at a level ofdetail currently unimaginable. ?With the anticipated increase innetworked-microsatellites in the next few years, such a platform might be thebest ? and only ? means of collecting technical intelligence in space.?

Dolmanalso sees another use for the automated X-37B. It could be pressed intoservice, he said, not only as a resupply vehicle for routine resupply ormaintenance of space platforms, even for the International Space Station as apublicly visible mission.

?Ifa reasonably-priced, reliable transport for supply and maintenance becomesoperational, a whole new set of on-orbit possibilities opens up,? Dolman noted.?What the U.S. Air Force has not had is a dedicated, secure platform forweapons research and, potentially, testing.?

Laser anddirected energy testing ? to include relaying beams ? could be done oncivilian platforms in small strengths for communications or power-generatingapplications. Still, the results needed for weapons research would beunsatisfactory and potentially compromised, Dolman said. ?All of the informationleaked about the X-37B suggests its primary function will be as a testplatform, but a test platform for what??

Whilethere will be some who suggest the X-37B is a program that just limped along,?it seems there are at least a few U.S. Air Force planners who are looking tothe future, as well as a few civilian supporters who see the value in areusable space plane, Dolman observed. ?The X-37B is a viable and importantproject whose time is past due.?

Technology-fedarms race

MarkGubrud is a physicist in the Laboratory for PhysicalSciences at the University of Maryland in College Park, and a proponent ofspace arms control. As a robot shuttle, he senses that the X-37B would finallygive the U.S. military flexible two-way access to space, as well as some in-planemaneuver capability in orbit.

TheX-37B is a product, in part, of the maturing of robotics, space robotics,military robotics and the military's confidence in robotics, Gubrud suggested.

?Weare seeing a partly technology-fed arms race. But the technology for spaceweapons is still quite exquisite and needs extensive development and testing,? Gubrud said. ?I don?t see the X-37 itself as a space weapon,because it is probably too expensive to use it that way,? he said, comparedwith the kind of alternatives ? smaller, more specialized space weapons ? thatthe X-37B could be utilized to test and develop.

Gubrud pointed out there is a realistic way tolimit the threat posed by the X-37 or similar vehicles produced by any country.That is, to account for their numbers and demand that they be kept either inverifiable storage or in use for declared non-weapons purposes, and that thenumbers be commensurate with their declared purposes.

Tothat end, ?basic information about the payload mass and volume, burnoutvelocity, orbital maneuver capability and remotely observable characteristics,as well as the numbers of such vehicles, should berequired to be reported,? Gubrud suggested.

Under the original requirement, Charter had to expand its service to 2 million additional households within five years. But half of those households had to already be served by another broadband internet provider, forcing the cable giant to compete.

The commission has now voted to change that qualification. Charter will still have to reach 2 million more households within the next five years, but all 2 million will have to be households getting wired for the first time. Charter actually won’t be allowed to count areas where it’s competing.

Bad for competition, good for rural buildout

Reuters first reported that the change had been approved, and an FCC spokesperson confirmed the measure’s adoption in an email to The Verge. Charter did not respond to a request for comment.

While the change is bad for competition, it isn’t bad on the whole. One of FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s core goals is to expand broadband access to rural areas that still don’t have it; and viewed in that light, changing this requirement makes a lot of sense. Instead of serving a million homes that already have broadband, Charter will end up wiring a million homes that had no high-speed options before.

The downside is that competition in the wired cable market is still embarrassingly poor in the US. Most households only have one option for wired internet provider, which gives cable companies the leeway to charge high prices for speeds slower than what are offered in other countries.

To see how far a little bit of competition can go, you can just look to the rollout of Google Fiber. Even the threat of Fiber’s expansion got AT&T and Comcast to start deploying gigabit internet. That’s likely the reason the commission, during the Obama administration, decided to force Charter into competing.

Cable companies tend to avoid competing with each other whenever possible, which is what’s caused this problem. In fact, it wasn’t strictly Charter pushing to end this requirement — Charter seemed to be trying to find a way to squirm around it. It was smaller cable companies, which complained that Charter would likely end up competing with them and possibly putting them out of business.

Pai says the competition requirement was like “ordering two entrées” for one person

In a statement, Pai said the original merger requirement “was not and is not in the public interest” and that “it runs directly against the goal of promoting greater internet access for all Americans.”

Pai also made this puzzling analogy to help people understand why he was against it: “This is like telling two people you will buy them dinner, ordering two entrées, and then sending both to just one of your companions.”

The FCC’s lone Democratic commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, was generally accepting of the change but said that she wished the commission had gone harder of Charter in the first place. “It is unfortunate that because we did not push New Charter to go further, in this order we must decide either that competition must suffer or unserved Americans should go without broadband,” Clyburn writes.

Clyburn largely seems to think the change is a good one, though. Even though she would like to see additional broadband competition, she fears the commission’s requirements would just lead to Charter knocking out smaller broadband providers, as those companies fear. “It has become clear that forcing New Charter into competing with another carrier incentivizes the company to overbuild where the weakest potential competition currently exists,” she writes.

By requiring Charter to build out to entirely unserved areas, Clyburn says, the expansion could provide high-speed internet to “almost three percent” of households that currently don’t have a broadband option.

Update April 3rd, 6:22PM ET: This story has been updated with comments from Pai and Clyburn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0000414-2458e54b52f3a3c4a97b2fe4333e0631.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012377 00000000000 014737  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The head of Democracy Watch is calling for changes to how political parties raise money in Newfoundland and Labrador.

"It really is a system of legalized bribery overall," Duff Conacher told CBC.

"That's why it's so insidious. It has to be stopped, because of the undemocratic, unethical effects it still has."

Most other provinces, and the federal government, put limits on what people can donate. The federal government and an increasing number of provinces have also banned unions and companies from donating to political parties.

Overall that system is corrupting decision making. - Duff Conacher, Democracy Watch

In Newfoundland and Labrador there are no limits. Anyone can give an unlimited amount of money and they don't even need to live in the province to donate.

In Ontario, the Liberal government recently banned union and corporate donations after controversies over private fundraising events.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced new limits on fundraising events that have been described as "cash for access."

Democracy Watch says people in this province should be even more concerned.

"What everyone in Newfoundland and Labrador should realize is the system is the scandal, and the system is corrupt," said Conacher.

"You may not see a particular scandal where you will be able to connect a donation exactly to the handing out of the contract, but overall that system is corrupting decision making."

Both the Liberals and PCs do the bulk of their fundraising through two big annual events. A golf tournament and $500-a-plate dinner with the leader attract a lot of companies that do business with government.

Construction, paving, engineering and architecture firms all donate.

For example, consulting company EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young) donated $2,300 to the Liberal Party in 2014, the last year for which donation lists have been published, and in 2016 members of the firm bought seats at the Liberal fundraising dinner.

The company has received several high-profile contracts to review Muskrat Falls and libraries, and to help decide how a new long-term care centre in Corner Brook should be built.

Those contracts, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, didn't have to be tendered, meaning government could pick whichever firm it wanted to.

None of that is against the rules, and many companies who receive government contracts donate to political parties.

But situations like that are why Memorial University political science professor Kelly Blidook is also calling for a ban on corporate and union donations.

"Do you want paving companies, or do you want construction companies giving money to people who are going to be in cabinet or who might get to make decisions? And, similarly, do you want unions doing that, potentially giving money to people who might see negotiations with them eventually?" said Blidook.

"I don't think any of that fosters the sense that a regular citizen would look and say, 'That's all right. I think that's a good idea.'"

Premier defends rules

"It's not legalized bribery. I don't see it that way at all," Premier Dwight Ball told CBC News.

"The most important thing is that when people make a voluntary donation to a political party there is a transparent process, everyone knows how much, the value, the name, when the donation is met. That money is then used to support campaigns of all political parties."

I've never opened a door because someone made a political donation. - Dwight Ball

Even though fundraising events give donors a chance to socialize with MHAs and cabinet ministers, Ball insists that money doesn't buy you access to his government.

"I've never opened a door because someone made a political donation," he said. "There's a lot of people that I call around this province on a regular basis that have never donated a dollar to this party.

"I certainly do not look at the donation list of the Liberal party when I make the decision to meet with someone."

Limit donations to $100: Democracy Watch

Democracy Watch says Quebec has the best political donation rules.

In a bid to fight corruption the province banned corporate and union donations.

Individuals can give $100, and that money is often matched by the province.

To make up for the lost revenue, parties also receive money for every vote they received in the last election.

Ball opposes any system that sees tax money go to political parties.

Blidook says giving public money to parties may be a tough sell but it's better than the current system.

"I think that a more democratic system actually has some form of tax money going to political parties, said Blidook.

"I just recognize that most people see that financially as a difficult thing to do."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0000238-eb2def2b077e8abc6861546c1785d4ec.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010530 00000000000 015247  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Buying a house isn’t as easy as reality TV would have us believe.

From bait-and-switch marriage proposals to wig-pulling, cocktail-tossing catfights, it’s safe to say we’ve grown accustomed to absurd contrivance and scripting in “reality” television. But who would expect such dramatic puppet-mastering on HGTV?

Apparently we all should have. Earlier this week on the website Hooked on Houses, former House Hunters participant Bobi Jensen called the show a sham. Jensen writes that the HGTV producers found her family’s plan to turn their current home into a rental property “boring and overdone,” and therefore crafted a narrative about their desperation for more square footage. What’s more, producers only agreed to feature Jensen’s family after they had bought their new house, forcing them to “tour” friends’ houses that weren’t even for sale to accommodate the trope of “Which one will they choose?”

This does not sound like the network ethic that HGTV general manager Kathleen Finch told Slate’s June Thomas about in a February interview, during which she defended HGTV as “a network of journalistic storytelling, not dramatic storytelling,” claiming that producers are “very conscious of not allowing any kind of fake drama.” That was then. On Tuesday HGTV issued a classic hedging statement, telling Entertainment Weekly that, yes, producers recruit families who have already done most of the house-hunting legwork to accommodate production time constraints, but that “because the stakes in real estate are so high, these homeowners always find themselves RIGHT back in the moment, experiencing the same emotions and reactions to these properties.”

Surely any one of us could feign disappointment on takes 10, 11, or 12 when encountering laminate rather than hardwood floors, but HGTV’s qualification doesn’t begin to address Jensen’s claim that the show films house tours of homes that are not even for sale.

So what’s the problem? By now, the onus is on the viewer to consume all “reality television” with a chuckle and a grain of salt. The genre’s underlying appeal is often rooted in its escapist, aspirational qualities (or, at other end of the spectrum, its indulgence of our basest schadenfreude). But House Hunters was always much more about showing us an attainable reality than a fantasy. The show (and its many iterations), in which people just like us (juggling budgets, worried about school districts, pulled between city and suburb), go shopping for the best home their money can buy, not only glorifies the dream of home ownership, but makes it seem achievable. (If that IT guy and his elementary school teacher wife can successfully get out of their dingy apartment and into a new home with the requisite granite countertops, “marriage-saving” double vanities, and bedroom-sized walk-in closets, so can I!) This plays right into our inexplicably unwavering attachment to home ownership: Despite the collapse of the housing market, polling continues to demonstrate that we regard owning a home as the cornerstone of the American Dream—a perception that undoubtedly played a role in the home-buying craze prior to the bubble’s burst.

Showing houses that aren’t even for sale at prices divined by its producers, House Hunters is presenting dangerous misinformation about the home-buying process and deleting all of the accompanying complications and consequences. It’s turned what is actually a messy, frustrating, often dead-end process into a seamless (and perhaps necessary) path toward fulfillment. What’s more, it seems likely that viewers use the prices, locations, and home criteria discussed on the show as barometers for their own house hunts because the information is presented as fact. No, House Hunters does not explicitly condone selling one’s soul for a white picket fence, and other HGTV shows like My First Place and Property Virgins do delve into money and home-inspection woes from time to time. But doesn’t HGTV have some obligation to portray the housing market as it is, or, at the very least, offer a pronounced disclaimer about the producers’ creative and logistical liberties?

Maybe they could fix this whole mess and wipe the slate clean with a good old fashioned “where are they now” episode, showing us the truth after those mortgage payments start taking a toll.                                                                                                                                                                        0000334-0bb4216851690e59823aa6560f9fd60c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015332 00000000000 014663  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        As Russia sees it, Bill Clinton turned the American Air Force into air support for an Islamic revolution against the Orthodox world. The attack against the Serbian homeland was an exercise of naiveté equivalent to bombing Vatican City then wondering why Roman Catholics might be upset and stay upset. Then George Bush decided it would be a good idea to place a missile defense system in Poland, disregard Russia's advice and invade Iraq and further insult and encircle the heart of the Eastern Orthodox world.

It takes a special breed of a-historical American president who is steeped in the Protestant idea of denominationalism; wherein Methodists, Presbyterians, Southern Baptists etc., all do their thing and somehow get along, to so thoroughly misunderstand the fact that Russia is reemerging first and foremost as a country reconnecting with its Orthodox historical imperial roots. We just have no concept of blood ties, soil and holy tradition in America. Since we don't take tradition seriously we can't believe that anyone else does.

For us the bottom line is always expediency and "what works." But in other parts of the world national pride is tied to a continuity of historic tradition (as was just demonstrated so beautifully in the opening ceremonies at the Beijing Olympics steeped as they were in Confucianism, and imperial history.)

In Russia's case its public humiliation at the hands of the United States, following the Cold War, could not have been designed better to have produced the invasion of Georgia. What's going on is the slow-motion counterattack of the Orthodox world against the West's latest crusade. Georgia is just a symbol for the counter-punch to the modern version of the West's sack of Constantinople in 1204.

Bill Clinton bombed Russia's closest and oldest Orthodox ally into submission and did so to send a half-baked and ill-conceived (utterly useless) message to the Islamic world that while we might favor Israel 99% of the time, once in a while we would throw the Muslim world a scrap. Note: America's actions in Serbia never were about halting ethnic cleansing. If that had been our motivation the same president that was bombing bridges in heart of Orthodox Europe while taking sides in a civil war, would have bombed Rwanda then (and we'd be in Darfur now) and have stopped those actual genocides. And now Russia is sending a message too, by attacking the pro-Western Georgia. And, yes, Georgia is also an Orthodox country, but it too is being used to send a message: we will hit back.

Europe may see itself as wholly secular these days but George Bush is your typical American Protestant evangelical exporting his version of Jesus as the Lord-Of-Consumerism and "democracy" to the world. In defense of his war on Iraq, Bush said that he believed that God wanted all people to be free. His idea of freedom is the interdenominational Protestant/American version.

President Bush was willing to impose this vision by brutal force of arms. Clinton and Bush both bought into the idea that America is specially called by God to "civilize" the world by imposing our version of Protestant/Western norms and/or to use an Orthodox country as cannon fodder to "send a message" with. Bush also wanted to send a message by attacking Iraq. Sure, they had nothing to do with 9/11 but hey, lets beat up an Arab, any Arab will do.

The United States and the West have been busy insulting and humiliating the Orthodox world since the end of the Cold War. We have missed every opportunity to show magnanimity as victors of the Cold War. American evangelicals invaded Russia with missionaries, because they said the Orthodox aren't "real Christians." We bombed Serbia. We treated the other global nuclear power as a younger dumber cousin. We attacked their friends. We lectured them.

Now we expect Russia to be logical about these matters and do what is good for business. But we have forgotten that not everyone in this world is ready to forgo their heritage for a fast buck. We also failed to discipline our energy consumption, and decided to have fun instead of going green while the cheep gas lasted. Thus we've been empowering Russia and all the oil states, by transferring our wealth to them in order to fuel our weekend junkets to Vegas and Disneyland.

We have forgotten that ties of faith and history have not been overwhelmed by modernity elsewhere, as they have been in America. The world is not a melting pot. Nor is every culture as frivolous and forgetful as ours.

We shop for church experiences as we shop for everything else folding religion into our consumer culture. The average American (who is religious) changes churches six or seven times during a lifetime, even changes religions. (Disclosure: I was raised in the evangelical right wing, left and in 1990, converted to the Greek Orthodox Church and also changed from a lifelong Republican to an Independent voter, who is an Obama supporter.) No wonder that Bush and Clinton just didn't get it. Religion is a game we play.

As Russia flexes her muscles we're reminded that history and religion are serious matters for some people, not just products to try then discard. We are also learning (again) that we had better know what we're doing before we interject ourselves into other cultures, say by bombing Serbia, or invading Iraq, or putting missiles in former Eastern Europe.

Apparently we still don't get it. All we can come up with is hand wringing and/or more bellicose smart ass -- "All I see is KGB in his eyes" -- posturing by the discredited likes of John McCain. Idiots like McCain have amused themselves by posturing about Russia, as if we are in any position to "do something" about a country with more nuclear weapons than we have when we can't even "fix" pitiful ragtag little Iraq in 6 years and still can't find bin Laden.

McCain is talking tough on Russia as is his mentor Bush. And these are the same men who have led the way in starting the wrong war in Iraq thus stretching our military so thin that we probably couldn't repel an attack by Canada these days. And they want to talk tough?

So why is Russia invading? It's payback thumb-in-your-eye time. Clinton attacked Serbia. Bush and NATO have humiliated the resurgent Orthodox Russia. The West has further humiliated the Orthodox world by recognizing the breakaway Muslim state of Kosovo.

America bombed Serbia and invaded Iraq using weaponry developed for the Cold War. Now Russia has taken its tanks out of mothballs and is doing the same thing on its doorstep. Someone said, "if you live by the sword you will die by the sword." Instead of more hot air McCain-style, what we need is to admit we have been very stupid about dealing with post-Soviet Orthodox Russia, and look for ways to repair the damage that Clinton and Bush have done and that McCain promises to exponentially increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000287-8bc35298443b1626ce8578e86fa33f35.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007103 00000000000 014712  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Uploading your files to the cloud might be fashionable these days, but some still like to keep their files, photos, videos, and anything else secure from prying eyes, yet still accessible if they're not at their computer. Synology, a maker of Network Attached Storage devices, which the company calls DiskStations (DS for short), has updated four of its apps; DS photo, DS file, DS note, and MailPlus.

DS photo

DS photo only has one update on its changelog, but it's a biggie: Android TV support. While it may not look that big to anyone who doesn't use Synology hardware and software for photo storage, for users of the service, this might be a big improvement: now photos can be shown off to friends or family on a larger screen, instead of peering at them on a tablet or phone.

Sadly, I was not able to get DS photo screenshots on Android TV.

WHAT'S NEW - DS photo DS photo is now available on Android TVs, allowing you to enjoy photos and videos on the large screen of selected smart TV models or with a smart set-top box.

DS file

There are more changes in other Synology DS apps though. DS file, a file manager for the NAS server, can now do automatic backups of files from your mobile device to the DiskStation - previously items would have to be moved manually - and files on the DS server can be shared to other apps on your phone as well. Files with duplicate names can also be overwritten or renamed as well, eliminating the possibility of losing important documents or other such things due to another item having the same name. There are also new security settings in the form of passcode or fingerprint locks on the app, keeping your files and server secure.

DS file

WHAT'S NEW - DS file Supports backing up photos and videos automatically from your mobile device to the Synology NAS

Supports passcode lock and fingerprint lock to protect user privacy

Supports sharing files on the Synology NAS to other mobile applications

Supports renaming and overwriting uploaded files that have same names as existing files on the Synology NAS

Fixed an issue where file operations might fail after DS file had its background data cleared and was relaunched

Minor bug fixes

DS note and Synology MailPlus

Two other Synology apps to see updates are DS note and Synology MailPlus. DS note now supports moving notes to an external SD card, fingerprint lock for security and privacy, and the ability to add notes to a shared notebook that someone else owns. Meanwhile, MailPlus has better conversation view for better mail browsing, passcode or fingerprint lock support, and integration with Synology Calendar to add events by tapping on the date or time.

DS note

WHAT'S NEW - DS note Supports moving DS note to an attached SD card

Supports fingerprint lock to protect user privacy

Allows non-owner users to add notes in shared notebooks

Fixed an issue where selecting or processing multiple to-do tasks at one time might cause app crash

Fixed an issue where long pressing on note text in the view mode might cause app crash

Fixed an issue where selecting destination for note links might fail

Minor bug fixes

WHAT'S NEW - Synology MailPlus Changed to the conversation view for better mail browsing

Supports adding events to Synology Calendar by tapping dates/times in mail

Minor bug fixes

Synology MailPlus

There are, of course, the usual bug fixes and such for these apps, as there always is. All these updates are now available in the Play Store. Keep in mind that to use DS photo, DS file, or DS note, you must have a Synology NAS server set up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000062-f5aef64dfedb980636542ea348fbc204.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004202 00000000000 015237  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The new southeast leg of Calgary's ring road is now open to traffic after a nearly two-month delay.

All revisions to the contract that were required have been completed, said Parker Hogan, spokesperson for Alberta Transportation.

The opening was originally scheduled for Oct. 1 but the contractor missed the deadline.

"Calgary's growing, all of Alberta's growing due to our strong economy, and Deerfoot is overburdened with the sheer volume of traffic," said Alberta's transportation minister, Ric McIver.

"Welcome to probably 20 minutes more of sleep for a whole lot more Albertans, or an extra cup of coffee or a little more time with the kids before school."

Alberta Transportation says the road will likely be open for the Friday afternoon rush hour following a media event in the morning.

The $769 million project, which stretches 25 kilometres and extends Stoney Trail past Peigan Trail to Highway 22x, has taken three years to build.

The six-lane expressway has nine interchanges, 27 bridge structures and three flyovers — two for rail, one for motorists. It brings Calgary's ring road to 70 kilometres in length.

A $70,000 fine was levied against Chinook Roads Partnership for each day past the missed deadline.

That's a total of $3.64 million for the 52-day delay.

Last leg to go ahead

"Right now it's a horseshoe road. It's a very nice horseshoe road, but a ring road has to be a ring,” said McIver.

Last month Tsuu T’ina First Nation members voted to allow the southwest — and final — leg of the ring road to be constructed through their reserve.

That section will stretch from Highway 22x to Highway 8 just west of the city's edge on First Nation territory and then continue north using the 101st Street corridor up to the Trans-Canada Highway.

Marilyn Gloer of Lethbridge, says he's excited for road to finally open.

"Our two reasons for coming to Calgary are either to come visit our grandson or to fly out of Calgary," he says.

"It will cut the travel time to the airport and don't have to use the Deerfoot."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0000314-f2aaf7b07b0b1c66d7154af4518c7df8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004214 00000000000 015231  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A lot of weird things happen on Reddit, so it normally wouldn't be all that interesting to hear that someone is posting strange comments. But listen, someone is posting some really strange comments.

A user named _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 joined the site yesterday and started discussing the historical context brought up by various posts. It just so happens that the context they're providing describes some eerie alternate world:

The Soviets designated large portions of the Ukraine countryside as "harvest populations." Basically, their food and water supplies were dosed with LSD until they had achieved what the Soviets called "integration." This meant that the local populations had independently invented flesh interfaces. The Soviet army would then quarantine the area and try to remove the flesh interfaces for their own use. This was usually without success and with great loss of life.

Over the course of 13 comments yesterday, _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 continues to build out a seriously creepy sci-fi universe with comments suggesting that they — or all of us — actually live there. There's heavy discussion of LSD and what sound like fleshy portals that slice people and objects in half and grant entry to some unknown universe where time moves slower. It all sounds pretty horrifying.

I won't give away too many details because there's a lot of fun in following along with this user's comments, starting off bewildered and confused and then slowly coming to understand the strange world being described. _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 is yet to post today, but hopefully they'll continue to deliver new details from their alternate universe.

Creating a narrative through online message boards isn't a brand new concept — it was famously done in the early 2000s by someone claiming to be a time traveler named John Titor. But just because it's been done before doesn't mean it isn't worth reading a new twist on the idea. There's still something remarkably compelling about reading about a bizarre reality in Reddit comments. Maybe they'll turn out to be some marketing scheme, but for now I'm in agreement with programmer Innes McKendrick, who brought these comments to my attention:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0000417-92cbdfff7657627a1849890aa5139833.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004531 00000000000 014711  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Secret To Emotional Control Most People Don’t Know

Better emotional control is linked to lower levels of depression and anxiety.

The key to healthy emotional control is to be flexible, new research finds.

People with lower levels of depression and anxiety tend to vary their emotional control strategy successfully depending on whether the situation can be explained.

Dr Peter Koval, one of the study’s authors, said:

“Our results caution against a ‘one strategy fits all’ approach, which may be tempting to recommend based on many previous findings regarding reappraisal as a strategy for regulating emotion. Simply using any given emotion regulation strategy more (or less) in all situations may not lead to the best outcomes — instead, contextually-appropriate emotion regulation may be healthier.”

For the research, people were tracked over a week.

They were asked to indicate how they managed their emotions and how much control they had over the situation.

People with the highest levels of mental health tended to change their strategy more based on how much control they had.

When they had less control — in other words, they couldn’t change things — they tended to reappraise the situation.

Reappraisal involves thinking about a situation in a different way.

E.g. “I’ve been rejected romantically, but at least I tried, maybe next time I’ll be more lucky.”

But when they had more control — in other words, they could do something about the situation — they tended to avoid thinking differently.

The study’s authors write:

“We found that people with higher well-being increased their use of reappraisal as contexts became less controllable, whereas individuals with lower well-being showed the opposite pattern.”

The reason reappraisal is bad when you have control, is that it stops you doing something about the situation.

The study’s authors explain:

“When a situation can be directly changed, reappraisal may undermine the adaptive function of emotions in motivating action.”

When the situation can be changed, it is better to let your emotions — whatever they may be — motivate that change, rather than trying to change the emotions.

When the situation can’t be changed, however, it is better to try and change the emotion.

The study was published in the journal Psychological Science (Haines et al., 2016).                                                                                                                                                                       0000415-a890640683bff6e5e0928373446040c9.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004443 00000000000 014537  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        #CalExit backers submit official ballot proposal to Attorney General

Californians supporting the idea of a secession from the United States are celebrating a milestone this week with the submittal of a ballot proposal to the state's Attorney General that would amend language in the State Constitution.

The proposal (here in PDF) requests two things. First, it asks that the part of Article III, Section 1 of the California Constitution stating that the California is an "inseparable part of the United States of America" be repealed in 2018. Second, it calls for an addition to the elections code, requesting that in 2019, the California Secretary of State administers a direct vote for Californians, wherein they will decide if the state should become "a free, sovereign, and independent country."

At this point, those who would like to comment on the proposal have 30 days to do so through the Attorney General's website. Yes California is planning on collecting signatures for support of the ballot next year.

While the California secession campaign began before the election, it has garnered significantly more interest since Donald Trump won the electoral vote. Some Californians are firmly invested in what's been dubbed a #CalExit, while others have voiced support for the state to become a province of Canada instead. All proposals are at this time unlikely to pass.

“We’ve had an amazing response from famous people for some reason,” creator Steven Knight told Radio Times before listing off the likes of Snoop Dogg, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Stephen Ling and Ed Sheeran.

Among those names was music icon David Bowie, who was such a massive fan he cosplayed as a Shelby and sent the picture to Murphy.

“He sent a photo of himself with razor blades in his cap to Cillian about a year ago,” Knight explained. “I got in touch with his people who came back straight away and said he was a big, big fan.”

Before his tragic death, Bowie never managed to visit the show’s set, but was apparently keen to have his music featured on the show.

According to Knight, a representative of Sony came to his house a week before his last album Blackstar was released to play him the record. “It seems that his people were keen to establish that we could use it before he died,” Knight added.

Season three of Peaky Blinders is fast approaching, with an air date of the 5 May on BBC Two. Recently, a trailer for the show dropped online, featuring glimpses of Polly (Helen McCrory), Arthur (Paul Anderson) and Paddy Considine’s Priest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0000402-dd0a47e868534eefbf9dfeb9f6461ad7.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000020340 00000000000 015420  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        For other people named William Dudley, see William Dudley (disambiguation)

William McGarvey "Bullet Bill" Dudley (December 24, 1921 – February 4, 2010) was a professional American football player in the National Football League for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Detroit Lions, and Washington Redskins. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966 and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.[1][2][3]

Early life [ edit ]

Dudley was born in Bluefield, Virginia and attended Graham High School.[4] He made the football team his junior year, and in 1938 he kicked a 35-yard field goal in the season's finale and helped Graham beat favored Princeton High School, 10–7.[5]

College career [ edit ]

At the age of 16, Dudley was awarded an athletic scholarship by the University of Virginia football team by coach Frank Murray.[4] As a result, he received a $500 grant, out of which he paid for room, board, and books.[5] He also pledged and became a brother of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Although he was originally slated as a punter and placekicker, Dudley eventually came to play the halfback position.[4] In his sophomore year, he began as the fifth back on the depth chart but, due to a teammate's injury, played several games.[5]

By his third year, Dudley started every game and was the Southern Conference's leader in total offensive yards. He was also successful in his senior year, particularly during a game against the University of North Carolina. In that game, Dudley scored all three touchdowns for Virginia and kicked four extra points.[4] That season, he became the first Virginia player to earn All-America honors and was awarded the Maxwell Award for best college football player of the year.[4] He was also named the best college player of the year by the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club.[5] Dudley also led the nation in four categories: touchdowns with 18; points scored with 134; rushing average with 6.2 yards a play; and touchdowns responsible for with 29. After the season, he played in the East–West Shrine Game, where he intercepted four passes and threw for his team's touchdown in a 6–6 tie.[5] He also played in the College All-Star Game in Chicago.[5]

NFL rookie season (1942) [ edit ]

Dudley was drafted in the 1942 NFL Draft with the first overall pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers. During the 1942 season, he led the league in rushing with 696 yards on 162 carries and was then named to the All-Pro team.[4] He also completed 35 of 94 passes for 438 yards and two touchdowns, punted 18 times for a 32.0 average, returned 20 punts for 271 yards (14.0 avg), and ran back 11 kickoffs for 298 yards (27.0 avg), scoring once.[5] In the first game of his professional career, Dudley ran for a 55-yard touchdown and in his second game scored on a kickoff return.

Military service (1943–45) [ edit ]

In 1942, the U. S. armed services began drafting all eligible young men to fight in World War II. Dudley originally enlisted and was sworn into the Naval Air Corps, however they found out he needed to have his parents' consent, since he wasn't twenty-one.[5] Dudley then enlisted in U. S. Army Air Corps in September 1942, but there was an influx of recruits and Dudley was told he would have to wait three months before he began training.[4] This delay made it possible for him to finish his rookie season with the Steelers.

Dudley went through basic training in Florida and then attended flight school in Texas.[4] He then joined the Army's football team. In 1944, Dudley helped his team to a 12–0 record and was named the Most Valuable Player.[4] At the end of the war, Dudley was shipped to the Pacific and flew two supply missions.[5] He was then sent to Hawaii where the Army selected him to play in three more football games against All-Star teams.[4]

Return to the NFL (1945–53) [ edit ]

Dudley returned to Pittsburgh that fall and rejoined the Steelers's team for the last four games of the 1945 season.[4] In a game against the Chicago Cardinals, he ran for two touchdowns and kicked for two additional points and became the Steelers' leading scorer for that season. He also rushed for 204 yards and returned three kickoffs for 65 yards.[4]

In 1946, the Steelers hired a new coach Jock Sutherland and Dudley scored 48 points, which contributed to the Steelers' 5-5-1 record.[4] During that season, he became the league leader in rushing (604 yards), interceptions (10 total which he returned for 242 yards) and punt returns (27 total for 385 yards). In doing this, Dudley became the only NFL player to lead in four unique statistical categories.[4] He was named All-Pro and was awarded the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award. Dudley became the first (and as of 2007, only) person to win MVP awards in college, service, and professional levels.[4]

"Despite his lack of breakaway speed, Bill was the most

feared kickoff returner in the game. He passed sidearm,

like a kid, yet he had a fine completion average. He was

'too small,' but he was hardly ever hurt too badly to play.

He was the league's top ground gainer, yet he was also one

of the fiercest defensive tacklers and the best in the game at

interceptions. As one of the men who faced him ruefully admitted,

Bill could not throw a pass correctly and 'ran as if he was

staggering,' yet he could always find a way to beat you." Journalist Robert Smith, on Dudley's ability.[5]

Dudley was traded to the Detroit Lions after 1946, where he was offered three-year contract and $20,000 a season. He was elected captain of his team all three years, 1947–1949.[4] During his first year with the Lions, the team finished last. On October 19, 1947 against the Chicago Bears, Dudley returned a punt for an 84-yard touchdown. During 1947, he scored 13 touchdowns; seven on pass receptions, four on runs from scrimmage, one on a punt return, one on kickoff return and throwing two. In his last season with the Lions, he led Detroit in scoring for the third year in a row.[4]

At the end of the 1949 season, Lions coach Bo McMillin traded Dudley to the Washington Redskins, where he played for three seasons, during which he led the team in scoring every year.[4] On December 3, 1950 Dudley fielded a 60-yard punt kicked by Steelers' player Joe Geri. He ran over 30 yards before he reached his hands out of bounds, while keeping both feet in bounds, and caught the punt at the Redskin's four yard line, and then ran it for a 96-yard touchdown.[4] Dudley took a break during the 1952 season but returned in 1953. He retired at the end of the season due to knee injuries and an overall physical deterioration.[4]

Dudley was named first- or second-team All-NFL six times in his career and was named to three Pro Bowls. During his nine pro seasons, Dudley gained 3,057 yards on 765 rushing attempts, a 4.0 average, and scored 20 touchdowns; caught 123 passes for 1,383 yards and 18 touchdowns; returned 124 punts for 1,515 yards and three touchdowns; ran back 78 kickoffs for 1,743 yards and one touchdown; intercepted 23 passes and returned them for 459 yards and two touchdowns; and punted 191 times for a 38.2-yard average. He added 121 extra points and 33 field goals to his 44 touchdowns for a total of 484 points.[8] Dudley led his team in scoring during every one of his nine NFL seasons.[5]

Dudley is the only player ever with a rushing touchdown, touchdown reception, punt return for touchdown, kickoff return for touchdown, interception return for touchdown, fumble return for a touchdown, and a touchdown pass. He also had a touchdown via lateral and kicked PATs and field goals.

After retiring, Dudley was a scout for the Steelers and the Lions. In 1951, he then entered the insurance business in Lynchburg, Virginia with his brother Jim.[4]

Dudley was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966, and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.[4] The Downtown Club of Richmond, Virginia has sponsored the Bill Dudley Award since 1990, awarded each year to the state's top college football player.[4] Dudley is an unlockable free agent running back in the videogame Madden NFL 08.

Dudley served four terms in the Virginia House of Delegates.

Dudley suffered a massive stroke on January 30, 2010.[9] He died in his home in Lynchburg, Virginia on February 4, 2010.[10]

Over the next few months, perhaps longer, several dozen contributors will tell us what we need to know about a wide variety of figures—some obscure, some not—in one thousand words or less. Forthcoming: posts on Dwight MacDonald, Mozart, Chekhov, Foucault, Leo Strauss, Paul Gottffried, Charles Taylor, Irving Babbitt, Bernard Lonergan, Machiavelli, and many more.

When he was asked by Michael Albus to characterize the difference between his own approach and Karl Rahner’s, Hans Urs von Balthasar famously said, “Rahner has chosen Kant, or if you will, Fichte, the transcendental approach.And I have chosen Goethe, my field being German literature.”

For Kant, and the moderns in general, the notion that the unifying center of a thing really does appear in the individual thing was denied.When I see this particular tree, therefore, all I see is the appearance of this particular tree. If any generalizations are to be made about it, they will have to come from the side of the subject. This means that the classical transcendental properties of Being—unity, truth, goodness, and beauty—must no longer be conceived as properties of Being, but as characteristics attributed to Being from the side of universal subjectivity. All postmodernity has to do to achieve nihilism, it would seem, is to deny any universal subjectivity. Postmodernism is not so much an alternative to modernism as its reductio.

This may seem a strange way of beginning an essay about an important (and controversial) Catholic theologian of the twentieth century, but if one fails to grasp the importance of Balthasar’s recovery of the transcendentals as properties of Being, one has little hope of understanding his theological project. Indeed, the first thing that the newcomer to Balthasar will discover is that he wrote an entire theological trilogy organized around Beauty, Goodness and Truth—in that order, no less.

So what does this all mean? Modernity is the attempt to find catholicity apart from particularity. Simply put, modernity wanted Christian “values” without having to put up with the scandalous assertions that (1) one man, a Jew no less, at one particular time and from one particular place, held the key to the meaning of existence; and (2) this man safeguarded this teaching to a particular group of (sinful) men. The Enlightenment could have none of this, and so tried to understand this admittedly important “religion” “within the bounds of reason alone.”

Postmodernity, in its turn, came to regard this enterprise with incredulity. Reason, we are told, cannot and ought not aspire to universality, even if it is an abstracted one. All we have are the competing truth claims of differing cultural-linguistic groups, and the most we can ask for is tolerance of diversity.

In Balthasar’s view, postmodernity does not constitute an alternative to Enlightenment rationalism, but rather continues on its skeptical by denying that the whole might shine forth in appearances, thereby denying reality’s ability to put limits on the spiritual subject. As Patrick Deneen has rightly argued, the second phase of liberalism is to emancipate humans not just from nature (that was the first phase), but also from human nature. A nature that cannot be known cannot place parameters.

From a theological standpoint, the catholicity (universality) of Christ and his Church cannot be maintained if one goes down either the modern or postmodern path. As Balthasar puts it, the one who has lost his eyes for worldly beauty—the one who fails to see the mystery of Being shining forth in beings—will be blind to the Glory of the eternal God shining forth in this single man from Nazareth called Jesus Christ.

We could put this all more positively. If our access to the universal is always mediated through the particular, then why should it surprise us if the one, true God appeared to us in a particular man at a particular time, and insists on continuing to be present to us through a particular institution with particular sacraments?This is what Balthasar means by beauty or glory: the appearance of the universal in the particular, without in any way denying that universal’s genuine universality.

Here are a few corollaries of the foregoing:

1) Balthasar insists that we must recover our ability to see the natural order (i.e., creation) as a gift. Gifts are by nature sacramental: they signify more than they are. Here we might suggest that G. K. Chesterton, in essays like, “The Ethics of Elfland,” is the Balthasar of the common man.

2) By saying that the whole really does shine through in the part, Balthasar is preserving the possibility of knowledge, while preventing any attempt to contain Being in a finite concept. In other words, what shines through in this particular thing in front of me is always more than I can grasp and more than I can say. This guards against the twin dangers of rationalism and skepticism.

3) The sorts of questions that arise from these considerations are universal ones (the relationship between the One and the Many, the spiritual and the physical, the soul and the body, the eternal and the temporal, God and the world), and will be answered one way or the other, whether implicitly or explicitly. Since the teachings of Christian revelation shed light on these questions, Christian theology is universally relevant to all human questions.

4) The God question, therefore, is implicit or explicit in all human questions. Or, to quote Thomas Aquinas, to know anything is to know God implicitly. Or, again, God is in all things and inner-mostly.

5) Because the natural order is God’s first gift to human beings, one cannot and should not simply juxtapose the natural to the supernatural. The gift of Christ provides the foundation for the gift of creation, and the gift of creation, if looked at properly, points to the gift of Christ.This is true even if we could never have anticipated the newness that was given in Christ, which we couldn’t have.

6) Unless we are to imply that God was simply taken by surprise by sin (and ugliness), we must insist that there was already in God the capacity for dealing with the separation caused by sin. Balthasar locates that capacity in the “positive space” that has always existed between the persons of the Trinity.This space provides the conditions of the possibility for the Son of God to enter into the depths of the human condition without ceasing to love the Father or be “fully God.”

Beauty, that is, is big enough to handle the distortion caused by ugliness—or sin.

Ontario Provincial Police say three people were injured after a vehicle refused to stop when flagged on the eastbound Highway 407 near the 410, then went the wrong way on a ramp and crashed into a second vehicle.

The first vehicle was fleeing an OPP cruiser at the time of the collision that seriously injured a 37-year-old female passenger in the second vehicle. According to SIU spokesperson Jason Gennaro, the injured woman underwent surgery at St. Michael's Hospital earlier Saturday.

Two children that were passengers in the fleeing vehicle, aged seven and three, also suffered minor injuries.

After the head-on collision, the driver of the fleeing vehicle got out of the car and stole a cruiser parked at the scene of the incident.

The OPP say the urgency of the situation after the collision may have contributed to the driver being able to commandeer a police cruiser.

"Obviously we need to take care and take precautions for our vehicle … so that it is secure at all times," said Sgt. Kerry Schmidt.

"When we've got a head-on crash right in front of us, we're going to get out and respond immediately," he added.

Theft suspect

The police vehicle was later found abandoned in a condominium parking lot on Eglinton Avenue northwest of Winston Churchill Boulevard in Mississauga.

Schmidt says the OPP knows the identity of the driver who stole the cruiser, but they do not have anyone custody.

The SIU is called in whenever there is a report of death, serious injury or sexual assault involving police. It says five investigators, two forensic investigators and a traffic reconstructionist have been assigned to the case.

Investigators are urging anyone who may have witnessed the incident to contact the lead investigator at 1-800-787-8529 x2290.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0000351-3eeeb6b33b4e49db2bd94eaeb4db4f4b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002564 00000000000 015616  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Happily never after (Picture: Instagram/showmemakeup)

Finally, someone has found a way to make dressing up as a Disney princess sufficiently scary to be Halloween-appropriate.

Makeup artist Shonagh Scott has killed off all our favourite Disney princesses, in the name of creating a slightly disturbing series of makeup looks

‘Happily Never After’ shows Ariel, Belle, and more as we’ve never seen them before (nope, not as hipsters or hot dogs. Those have already been done). This time they’ve been brutally murdered, and have come back to a life of zombie-ing around and singing to animals.

Here’s Ariel, who had her voice box ripped out by Ursula. Pleasant.

Hillary Clinton went further than she typically goes in criticizing Trump

(CNN) Hillary Clinton, joined by billionaire investor Mark Cuban, used multiple events on Friday to question whether Donald Trump would put his financial interests over the well-being of the United States.

Clinton, at an event inside Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, painted a picture for voters where Trump would put his own financial security over what is best for voters.

"Ask yourself, so if he is sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries, is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of America's interests?" Clinton asked. "I can tell you this, when I am sitting across the table from the Russians or anyone else, I know who I am representing: the American people."

Cuban, who endorsed Clinton earlier this year and was born and raised in Pittsburgh, went a step further, suggesting that Trump, as president, would take bribes.

"A (Vladimir) Putin, or an (Julian) Assange, would say to him, 'Donald, if you do this, I will give you $20 billion.' What is 20 billion to them? What is 30 billion?" Cuban asked. "For them, that is nothing. If Donald Trump, who rips off people for thousand -- do you think he is going to do what is right for the country, or do you think he is going to take the money?"

Should freedom of speech include the right to insult and demean ideas and symbols people hold dear? Some insist that the very concept of freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend, while others maintain that needless & provocative speech that hurts others should, in no way, be tolerated.

In what appears to be a battle of ideas, Pope Francis has recently come out, siding with the latter opinion. On his way to Philippines, he commented that:

“One cannot react violently, but if (someone) says something bad about my mother, he can expect a punch. It’s to be expected.” “There are a lot of people who speak badly about other religions. They make fun of them. What happens is what happens with my friend (who insults my mother). There is a limit.”

To be fair, I understand and appreciate where he is coming from. Indeed, his call for mutual respect is to be lauded! I also maintain that difference of opinion should be tackled in a reasonable & fair way, and that freedom of speech comes with a huge responsibility.

However, as much as I admire the otherwise progressive stance of Pope Francis, I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the analogy he’s trying to present here. Make no mistake about it; this is the same line of reasoning that blames a rape victim (at least, partially) for wearing “provocative” clothes.

“She must’ve dressed inappropriately!”

All the while, ignoring the fundamental aspect that rape is about power, the urge to control, not sex per se.

Similarly, implying that there is a “limit”, which, if crossed, would unleash fanatics who would murder those that offend their religious sentiments, is, in a way, justifying their very presence. Their presence shouldn’t be taken for granted at all, rather we must devote our energies to getting rid of this twisted interpretation of Islam that these people subscribe to.

Furthermore, I am appalled that Pope Francis would justify hitting someone in response to an insult. Words, after all, should only be met with words – or by simply ignoring the remark. A slip of tongue, perhaps? I would certainly hope so!

Coming to the very idea of freedom of speech, I think the vital point to understand is that in a society where people are free to speak whatever they may wish, people are going to be offended. After all, people could take offence over literally anything! How far are we ready to curb (ironically) freedom of speech, then?

You see, a close minded person takes offense easily. The reality is, most religious people, at least in my experience, have a very superficial understanding of the religion they hold dear. Thus, with practically no tools (read: knowledge) to defend the very thing they hold dear, they resort to violence as a last resort to maintain their identity.

When I saw the cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo, mocking Prophet Mohammad, I felt no rage – no desire to persecute these cartoonists. Some of my coreligionists might tell you that I maybe weak in faith, that perhaps I am a “nominal” Muslim. After all, what else could explain such a resigned attitude? Yes, I simply do not care. Not because I don’t respect or admire Prophet Mohammad, but because I do.

Instead of going berserk over these cartoons, I chose to simply ignore them. Why, that is how Prophet Mohammad would respond, too!

“And be patient over whatever they say, and depart from them in a gracious manner.” Quran, 73:10

So, dear Pope, I hope you realize that the solution is not to curb freedom of speech, but to promote tolerance & spiritual maturity.

Why must we be bothered about how others are portraying Prophet Mohammad?

The real question is, how are we, Muslims, portraying him and his message?

Mohammed Imaduddin, a spokesperson for the Madrasah Islamiah Masjid Noor mosque near Bellaire, told news local news agencies the victim was a doctor, who had parked along the street before walking towards the mosque for the morning service.

Witnesses said the victim was appraoched by three masked men on foot before being stabbed without warning.

One of the individuals pulled out a gun and shot him, before the three attackers fled from the scene.

“It is very scary right now given the current political climate,” Mr Imaduddin told news station ABC 13, adding that there were children outside at the time of the incident.

“From what I hear, this is the third incident this week in the Houston area involving a Muslim getting shot. This is a community place, we have kids that come here, we have people young and old comes here.”

Investigators say the doctor was shot twice, and will remain in ICU for 24 hours, but is expected to survive his injuries. There is no known motive known for the attack.

The incident comes the day after another Muslim man was beaten up outside a mosque in Florida.

On my way to interview Sir Terry Pratchett I tweeted about our meeting.

The responses ranged from: “How amazing! He’s a fabulous writer and totally awe-inspiring person”, to “I hope you find him as well as can be expected” and “You and he are both doing so much for dementia”.

And that’s why we were meeting. To discuss his life now that it includes being the highest profile campaigner for Alzheimer’s while actually living with the disease.

The Discworld author first said he had it in December 2007, just over a year after I’d lost my mum Amy to early-onset Alzheimer’s.

It was a particularly bleak period as we were told that my dad Neville also had it.

Until then, I’d felt a bit of a voice in the wilderness, going on about the lack of understanding and good care.

Terry’s honesty was a eureka moment for me. Since then I had always wanted to meet him and he, apparently, was keen to see me.

But it didn’t seem that way when I introduced myself and went to shake his hand.

Dressed from head-to-toe in his trademark black, a top hat and frock coat, he looked like an authoritarian Dickensian char­­acter from his Oliver Twist-inspired novel Dodger.

When he didn’t offer his hand back my heart sank a little.

“He can’t see your hand,” his book publicist Lynsey explained.

Terry, 64, has a form of early-onset Alzheimer’s called PCA (Partial Cortical Atrophy) which affects the part of the brain responsible for visual signals.

As we sit down he reaches to fiddle with my phone, trying to make out what it is.

When I explain it is recording our conversation, he cheekily says “amateur!”

Terry’s twinkly-eyed humour made me, by contrast, recall my mum’s constant tears and depression.

“It surprises me. It surprises my specialist,” he tells me.

He has written eight books since his diagnosis and his doctor has told him he has “Terry Pratchett’s PCA, which isn’t like anyone else’s PCA.”

He can no longer use a keyboard but, instead, has a program which enables him to talk to his computer.

So, how else has his illness affected him?

“Words escaping just about the time you’re going to say something. You’ve got it lined up and suddenly it just slips away,” he says.

His words are very considered, his answers long and drawn out.

If he forgets a word there’s a silence as he cogitates, before returning to the point where he left off and continuing the anecdote.

I try not to ask too many questions so as not to interrupt his thoughts. You can almost hear the determination to hang on to facts and to maintain his fluency.

I ask him if he has trouble getting dressed, which is one of the first signs that a person may have cognitive difficulties and we joke about the fact that being dressed all in black makes it pretty hard to screw up.

“You’ll notice,” he adds naughtily, “that my hat is not on upside down.”

I note that his pants aren’t on his head either, which was sometimes the case with my dad.

“Well, pants are pants on the whole,” he chuckles, “and it’s not particularly easy to get them on back to front.”

As with most of us, Terry finds that a routine helps maintain his daily existence.

“I get up, pop my pills,” he says, referring to Aricept and Ebixa which can, in some cases, temporarily arrest the progress of Alzheimer’s.

He’s been paying for the drugs since he was diagnosed in his late 50s because you have to be 65 to get them free.

“I’ve got money, so I don’t notice,” he remarks, “but it annoys me.”

Does he appreciate that his experience of Alzheimer’s is a more privileged one than most?

“Oh, absolutely,” he says before mulling over the fact he’s still “fit for purpose if that purpose is to spend most of the day writing books.”

His books have sold more than 70 million copies and Terry is now almost as well known for talking honestly about living with Alzheimer’s but says: “I don’t like to be an icon in this matter because there are people far, far worse off.”

Then he says something astonishing: “I think the best thing I ever did with my life was stand up and say I’ve got Alzheimer’s.”

Terry, who married Lynne 44 years ago and has a 36-year-old writer daughter Rhianna, tells me that as a young journalist he was told never to use the word cancer, “as people were sensitive”.

The first time he heard it used was when broadcaster Richard Dimbleby died in 1965.

“And at last it seemed as though someone had opened a window and people were talking about it and so...”

At this point he loses his train of thought, concentrates, says: “I’m tripping over myself.”

Gathering his thoughts Terry adds: “Let me go back to the beginning of the sentence. I get all my clauses in the wrong place.”

He goes on to explain that once he was diagnosed it was almost as if he’d been told: “OK, you’ve got it, now go home and get on with it.”

I tell him the same thing happened to my parents.

Terry says: “If it was cancer it would be sorted. But with this you and your spouse are left in the lurch”.

It was then he decided to “tell everybody” about his Alzheimer’s.

He says he knows “a couple of well-known people” who have the disease “and aren’t saying” and he’s told them they could do so much good by opening up.

Mind you, his time hasn’t been his own since sharing his diagnosis.

“People come up to me in the street and tell me about their mum, their granny.

"One time, in Salisbury, a big lorry screeched to a halt and the man was in tears, talking about his mum.”

I wonder how Lynne, the spouse “left in the lurch”, is coping with the changes.

Terry says: “Hmmm, what’s the average day? Two cups of tea in bed, talking about stuff, me going down into my bathroom, do the pills... go and pick up pants.

“Lynne’s quite methodical about where stuff’s left. I know where to find the clean stuff and I put the dirty stuff in the other bag.

"Then I go down, open up the chicken coop and feed them, then I open up the chapel which is where I work... go for a walk... and that’s it.”

Does he ever get depressed? “No, my father was a stoic,” he replies before asking about my father.

I tell him he was killed by the overuse of drugs for his Alzheimer’s. “Ah, so that was murder,” he exclaims.

Then Terry expands, moving on to assisted dying. “My dad said to me when he knew he was dying... ‘if you ever see me just lying there with pipes and tubes, tell them to shut me down’.

“He was in a nice hospice but my mother had to watch him more or less start looking like an Egyptian mummy.

"The nurses were filling him with morphine, so that is an assisted death in the first place, so why go through all that s***e?”

He tells me he has Tony Nicklinson’s picture in his writing room and is furious that “he had to starve himself to death” instead of being allowed the right to die.

“If someone is compos mentis and his plea to die is witnessed by two doctors, how can an assisted death like that be murder?”

So, does Terry have an end-of-life plan? “Yes, I plan to die... it’s all the rage,” he cheekily retorts.

“I have a living will and I have friends, and I have money and I have hope.

“There are things around and I know where they can be got quite easily but I quite like waking up to the sunshine.

"I don’t think about the end game. I’ve got lots to occupy my mind. It’s the rage that keeps me going.”

And long may he rage against the dying of the light. I, for one, will always hold a candle to him.

While the Jets goaltending situation isn’t even close to resolved yet according to Sportsnet’s Elliote Friedman, incumbent number one goalie, Connor Hellebuyck is taking his training to a new level and working with a new goaltending mentor / personal trainer / sports performance coach…

Winnipeg’s Connor Hellebuyck is making some off-season changes. He will spend time this summer with Adam Francilia, who has a lot of experience working with goalies. Francilia could be loosely defined as a personal trainer, but prefers “sports performance coach” because he also deals with nutrition and mental health.

In a second ‘thought’ covering the Hellebuyck news, Friedman shared some of Francilia’s personal philosophy about the goaltending position and what some of the work Connor will be doing this summer:

“Goaltending is an unnatural position,” Francilia continued. “We are not created to be goaltenders, which is why so many have hip issues. We have to completely re-program their brains not to counter-rotate. Teach the brain to think differently, teach (Hellebuyck) to recruit his left oblique muscle to stabilize and offset the counter-rotation.

You can read Elliotte’s full comments and breakdown of Connor’s pending summer plans at thoughts 17 and 18 in his weekly “30 Thoughts” column which is – as we’ve mentioned before here – a must read for any hockey fan who wants to stay connected.

You may also want to take special note of thought #10 as well.. The Trouba rumors never stop yo!

As for Hellebuyck? Many people noted that there seemed to be a difference between Connor’s rookie year where he lived up to his “big and boring” play style to the following season where he was not as square to shooters, nor was he as quiet in his side to side movement in the crease. Overall it was noted that his play seemed more erratic than the year past.

It’s not 100% certain Hellebuyck will be the number one goalie at the start of the 2017-18 season, but it’s highly likely he is and hopefully the change to his summer training program provides better results in the fall. Francilia’s work is well known within the hockey world, so this should be seen as a big positive by Jets fans.                                                   0000424-6b796c95ad621f898e2f11326534795c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003661 00000000000 014634  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        About

Hi why should you back this project well first I am a gamer who loves old school games. I like the snes playing battle toads, donkey Kong Country and many more. Also the N64 and PS1, well lets just say I like a lot of games and consoles from 1990 to 2002. If I was to list all my favourite games well lets just say you would be here for a while.So I am passionate gamer and would love to make a book of iconic video game characters. I am also planning to include interesting historical facts about each character. I would love to hear what characters you think I should include in the book and why.

All the best, game on. Also my favourite game is.....Well that will be in the book so make it happen you have the power.

Funding for this project will be used to research characters histories and how they become what they are today, this will cause me to buy journals and find suitable sources to use within the book so all historical facts are true and would even like to request some interviews with leading game development companies like Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft and the voice behind Mario "Charles Martinet" to get the true history of many iconic characters. This will cost money and will not be cheap.The funding will also be used to set up meetings with printing and finical institutions to make the book a success and to fund the reward system on kickstarter.

McCollum is expected to make his NBA debut on Tuesday against the Sacramento Kings if his NBA Development League stint over the weekend goes well, a source told Yahoo Sports.

McCollum has yet to play this season due to a left foot fracture he suffered during a Blazers practice in October. The 10th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, McCollum was assigned to the Blazers' D-League affiliate Idaho Stampede on Wednesday. McCollum will be activated prior to Portland's game in Sacramento on Tuesday if he plays well and has no physical setbacks in D-League games against the Rio Grande Vipers in Boise on Friday and Saturday, the source said.

"I'm just looking to get back into a rhythm and finish out the last requirement of my rehab phase," McCollum told Yahoo Sports.

McCollum averaged 23.9 points, 5 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 12 games as a junior for Lehigh University during the 2012-13 season before suffering a left foot fracture that ended his season. The Blazers plan to play the 6-foot-4, 200-pounder about 18 minutes in both games at shooting guard for Boise this weekend to simulate the minutes he could eventually play with Portland. The Blazers will have a basketball and medical representative in attendance to watch McCollum.

McCollum's time in Boise will be his first action since playing for the Blazers' summer league team. Even if McCollum is activated, the source said he would have to overcome the challenge of working his way into the rotation to get minutes. The Blazers' current first guard off the bench is veteran Maurice Williams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000491-49e47d793f42d9fd4e7eb9c2a9986f07.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002717 00000000000 015161  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        RCMP are investigating two train derailments Tuesday in central Alberta caused by extreme winds.

Three Hills RCMP officers were called at around 5:20 p.m. after 28 freight cars derailed near Huxley, Alta., approximately 75 kilometres by car from Red Deer.

The rail cars, which were carrying 56 shipping containers, were blown off the tracks, RCMP say. No one was injured and no hazardous materials were spilled, but several homes in the area were evacuated as a precaution. Residents were allowed to return three hours after the derailment.

The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is sending a team of investigators to the scene.

At about 6 p.m., Wainwright RCMP were called to a train trestle near Township Road 542 for another reported train derailment.

Const. Leon Hoffman said five double-stacked cars were knocked off a trestle bridge near Fabyan by "extremely strong winds."

Wainwright is about 230 kilometres southeast of Edmonton.

Jacob Weichel arrived near the trestle at 6:05 p.m. and took a photo of the derailment.

"It was super windy but everyone looked safe, including the conductor," Weichel told CBC News.

CN Railway crews are currently on the scene.

Hoffman said no updates on the derailment will be available until Wednesday because it is too dangerous to send RCMP officers out in the field.

No injuries have been reported for either train derailment.                                                 0000131-1554cfb8d757ee084419d378dd4f5b7f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012240 00000000000 015117  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        As you probably know, there's a moneybomb underway to raise money for Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway's campaign challenging Rand Paul for U.S. Senate.

Well, it turns out that at least one member of Rand Paul's paid campaign staff has been posing as a progressive member of the Daily Kos community in an effort to dampen enthusiasm for Conway's campaign and moneybomb. The staffer, Thomas Kubica, is a paid intern in Paul's Bowling Green office. Paul campaign's front desk confirmed Kubica's status as a paid intern on Tuesday morning.

Kubica registered at Daily Kos under the pseudonym "Huey Long" and has repeatedly posed as a progressive Democrat who opposes Paul but does not believe Conway is worthy of support.

But despite his claim to be a progressive Democrat, look at how Kubica describes himself on his Linkedin page:

Thomas Kubica at Rand Paul for US Senate 2010

Political Organization | Greater Nashville Area

Current: Independent Contractor at Rand Paul for US Senate 2010 Past: Perishables Lab Analyst/Conservation Lab Analyst at Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute Education: Mercyhurst College

Compare that to this example of Kubica's concern trolling:

* [new] Nobody said Rand Paul was better (3+ / 0-)

Of course we want Rand Paul to lose, but does that mean we spend limited national resources on a candidate far behind in the polls who is a conservative democrat who opposes the most pressing progressive ideals? by Huey Long on Mon Sep 06, 2010 at 12:54:34 PM CDT

And another from Kubica, aka Huey Long:

Can we take Jack Conway off ActBlue now? (1+ / 0-) I've been following Jack for a long time now and I tried to warn you all that he was no good (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-Hbp_LjKq4). I can think of a million better places for progressives to send money than Jack Conway, starting with Democrats who OPPOSE Bush's tax cuts. by Huey Long on Thu Sep 02, 2010 at 04:08:37 PM CDT

And another one delivered just this morning:

Funny That's one hilarious accusation. I've been accused of being a far-left purist plenty of times, but never a Paultard! I'm sorry if trying to hold Democrats accountable irritates you. But I believe someone who claims to represent progressives and comes here to collect our money should at least answer for the anti-progressive stances he has taken. Believe it or not, I'm not a purist. John Kerry supported the Iraq war, but he later admitted it was a mistake and turned out to be a good choice for progressives. I worked hard on his campaign. But Jack Conway has taken far too many positions that align him more with Mitch McConnell than any other Democrat. I don't think he offers progressives anything worthwhile besides not being Rand Paul. by Huey Long on Tue Sep 07, 2010 at 11:20:24 AM CDT

Kubica has also penned diaries criticizing Conway from the left (here and here), each of them transparent attempts to dampen progressive enthusiasm for Conway.

It goes without saying that Kubica, as a concern troll, is unwelcome at Daily Kos. Daily Kos is a progressive community and its community membership are united by the goal of electing more and better Democrats to public office. While we are tolerant of a wide range of views within the "Big Blue Tent," make no mistake: this site is every bit as blue as it is orange. If Kubica had identified his role with his campaign, he would not have been welcome in the community, so he resorted to deception. Now that we know who he is, he's been banned, per community guidelines.

Moreover, we decided to take the unusual step of unmasking his identify because he attempted to conceal his identity not for the sake of protecting his personal privacy, but rather he did so for the purpose of manipulating opinion about a campaign for which he is a paid staffer, no matter how junior his role might be.

As stated in the Daily Kos FAQ:

Registered users working in paid (or unpaid positions of authority) for political campaigns must disclose their affiliation when it is relevant to the conversation.

Admin Moderation: Warning, suspension, banning and, in an exception to the outing rule, exposure of the paid person's real name.

Fortunately, Kubica's lame attempt at "psyops" was so transparent it was easy to catch him in the act. The only person more out of touch than a progressive who would support Rand Paul over Jack Conway is a Paultard who believes a "true progressive" would ever support Paul over Conway.

But what does it say about the Paul campaign that they would hire someone engaging in an attempted dirty trick like this? Everybody knows campaigns are tough business, but a gambit that involves attempting to manipulate the views and behaviors of your political opponents by posing as a like-minded ally is a gambit that goes too far. It's just plain wrong.

But it's not just wrong: Kubica clearly hoped to put a wet blanket on Conway's moneybomb today. He knows this community, when it gets engaged, and can move mountains. So let's step up to the plate and show what we can do: Let's support Jack Conway by contributing to his Fight Fund during today's moneybomb!

The blogger had written about an alleged affair between Strange and the campaign manager.

Jefferson County Circuit Judge Donald Blankenship on Monday entered a default judgment against Roger Shuler and his website Legal Schnauzer for $1.5 million in compensatory and $2 million in punitive damages. The judge wrote that all the elements for the judgment were present, including that a false and defamatory statement was made.

Jessica Medeiros Garrison, a Birmingham lawyer, filed the defamation lawsuit in 2013 against Shuler. She had managed Strange's 2010 campaign for Alabama Attorney General and served as Chief Counsel and Deputy Attorney General in 2011.

"The facts are clear and the judgment speaks for itself," Garrison stated in an email Tuesday to AL.com. "The absolute and blatant disregard for the truth has to come with consequences. I am very happy to finally be in a position to set the record straight," she wrote.

Bill Baxley, one of Garrison's attorneys, also said the ruling "speaks for itself." He said he doubts his client will be able to collect any money from Shuler, who had his house foreclosed upon a year or so ago.

Joel Dillard, another attorney for Garrison, said they are grateful that the judget returned a verdict that adequately compensates Garrison. "She is the righteous, kind, gracious working mother of a young son she adores, and this fact magnified this outrageous wrong. Shuler's statements about her were not just libelous, they were plucked from thin air, and were cyber-bullying of the worst order," Dillard stated.

Strange also issued a statement today.

"I am pleased the court has confirmed there was no truth to these lies and that some measure of justice has been done," Strange stated.

Shuler failed or refused to sit for a scheduled deposition. He was sanctioned by Judge Blankenship, who then set a March hearing for sanctions and default judgment.

At the March 9 hearing the judge heard testimony from Garrison and Strange. Both testified the allegations Shuler had written that the two had an extramarital affair and had a son together were false, according to the judge's order.

Shuler, or any lawyer representing him, did not attend the hearing.

Garrison testified that Shuler had written false comments in his Legal Schnauzer blog concerning her and Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, the judge's order states.

"The (Legal Schnauzer) comments suggested that the plaintiff (Garrison) received preferential treatment from the Attorney General because the two were engaged in an ongoing extramarital affair; and that the Attorney General was the father of the Plaintiff's minor son," the judge's order stated.

Garrison testified that the comments were false and "were embarrassing, hurtful and degrading."

"She testified further that the comments made it difficult to perform her job. She works with a national organization, The Republican Attorneys General Association," according to the judge's order.

Garrison also stated that since the comments have now become widely known, she constantly suffers from embarrassment and anxiety, according to the judge's orders. "She testified that she worries about how the comments could later affect her minor son."

Strange also testified that the comments concerning his relationship with Garrison and a photo on the website that was cropped to make it appear Strange and Garrison were alone, were false.

Attorney General Luther Strange

"The Court finds the comments defamatory," Judge Blankenship stated in his order.

Efforts to reach Shuler for comment were unsuccessful prior to publication of this story.

Last year a Shelby County judge also issued a writ of arrest for Roger Shuler, author of the Legal Schnauzer blog regarding motion to revoke Shuler's probation on his conviction on a misdemeanor resisting arrest charge. The motion states that Shuler failed to make payment of court ordered fees and fines and did not appear as ordered by the court.

Shuler was charged with resisting arrest last fall when he was taken into custody on a contempt of court charge filed by judge after Shuler, at least initially, refused to remove stories he had written on Legal Schnauzer that Rob Riley, the son of the former governor, had an affair.

Rob Riley had sued Shuler in October for libel and sought the injunction to force Shuler to remove the posts. The judge ordered Shuler to remove the post and ordered the blogger jailed for contempt when he didn't do it immediately. Shuler remained in jail until the judge ordered his release in March after his wife removed certain stories from the blog.

Shuler's incarceration for contempt drew national attention from groups that claims Shuler's First Amendment rights were violated. The ACLU and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed briefs on his behalf.

Weeks after the posts were removed Rob Riley complained that a very similar website with Shuler's posts had appeared. Shuler denied he had anything to do with the other website.

A lawsuit last year also sought to have Shuler and his wife removed from their north Shelby County house after a company bought it out of foreclosure.

In June 2007, James Watson, a co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, went to Houston to pick up his genome. At a ceremonial press conference at Baylor College of Medicine, scientists handed the 79-year-old Nobel Prize-winner a DVD on which they had recorded a highly accurate reading of all the DNA nestled in the nucleus of each of his cells. There was, however, one glaring gap.

Watson spoke at the conference about the value of genomes to medical research. “I think we’ll have a healthier and more compassionate world 50 years from now because of the technological advances we are celebrating today,” he declared. In addition to giving Watson his genome on a DVD, the Baylor team also put the sequence into the public database GENBANK, where scientists can download it and compare it to other publically available human genomes. But scientists will not be able to see one of Watson’s 20,000 genes. The gene encodes a protein called apolipoprotein E. A variant of the gene, called ApoE4, dramatically increases the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Watson’s grandmother had died of Alzheimer’s disease, and Watson decided he would rather not know if he carried the variant.

If Watson does, in fact, carry ApoE4, he would not have had much time to dread Alzheimer’s before the disease arrived. The mean age of onset of Alzheimer’s in people with one copy of ApoE4 is 76. In those with two copies, the age drops to just 68. Six years since receiving his genome, Watson is 85 and shows no sign of the disease.

Today, you don’t have to be James Watson to find out if you carry ApoE4. In 2011, the personal gene-testing company 23andMe began offering a test for the variant to anyone who sent them a DNA sample. After first reading a page of information and warnings, customers can see for themselves if they carry the variant—which may lead to decades of anticipating the possible decline of their senses.

Now imagine taking this sort of revelation to its logical extreme. You’re the parent of a newborn daughter. The doctors take a blood sample from her and run it through a genome-sequencing device. Within a couple days you get a full report on your daughter’s genome. It shows whether she has ApoE4 and how many copies she carries. Does she deserve to know what may lie ahead? Or should she enjoy a blissfully ignorant youth? Because you have her whole genome, and not just a test for a single gene, you can potentially look for a vast number of other gene variants that raise the risk of other diseases of adulthood, such as the BRCA1 gene for breast cancer. Should she get the whole report or not? Will you be prepared for what her genome sequence may reveal about you or your spouse, since she got all her DNA from you? And would the specter of a deadly gene loom over your years raising your child?

“The notion of sequencing everyone at birth has been around for a long time in a pie-in-the-sky way,” says Robert Green of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. But now, Green says, it’s rapidly approaching reality. Last week, Razib Khan wrote about getting his daughter’s DNA sequenced by 23andMe for a few hundred dollars. He didn’t get the full genome sequenced, but rather a few million genetic markers sprinkled across her chromosomes. Still, that was enough for Khan to determine her risk for at least one genetic condition.

The cost to sequence an entire genome is still substantially higher, at several thousand dollars. A few clinics in the United States are starting to sequence the full genomes of patients whose diseases can’t be identified by the standard battery of genetic tests, or whose diseases resist conventional treatments.

As the cost of sequencing genomes falls, our understanding of how variations in the genome affect our health is growing. And some medical researchers think that newborn genome sequencing could be a huge boon to people’s health. Looking over a baby’s genome, a pediatrician might spot a mutation linked to an aggressive childhood cancer, for instance. It could also allow doctors to avoid giving children medicine that would have devastating side effects. Children with certain variants of a gene called TMPT, for example, can’t break down some of the drugs used for leukemia, which end up poisoning their bone marrow.

But we cannot say in advance how much benefit genomes at birth would provide, nor can we predict how much anxiety they would create in children or their parents. Next year, however, Green and his colleagues are embarking on a study to start getting some answers to those questions. BabySeq, as the project is known, received a $6 million award last month from the National Institutes of Health, and will be led by Green at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Alan Beggs at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Green sums up the goal of BabySeq with a simple question: “If you have your genome readily available from birth, how is that likely to influence your life?”

Green and his colleagues are now putting together their protocol for the project. It will then be reviewed by an Institutional Review Board, which will evaluate the ethics of their plan. Green and his colleagues foresee enrolling 240 healthy babies from Brigham and Women’s and 240 sick babies from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Children’s Hospital. The BabySeq team will sequence half the babies in each group and provide the genomes to their doctors, along with information about what scientists have determined about the genetic variants carried by each baby. Green, Beggs, and their colleagues will then track the babies for at least a year, seeing whether any differences emerge between them and the unsequenced babies.

It’s easy to look at BabySeq and see it as proof that the future has arrived—whether you see that future as the golden age of personalized medicine or a dystopia fashioned after the movie GATTACA. But either conclusion would be wrong. The mutations that pose the biggest risks to children are very rare. In a group of 240 sequenced babies, such mutations may never turn up, and so the BabySeq team may never see how doctors use genomic information to guide their treatments. “The chances of finding something that really alters your sense of a child’s health is probably pretty small,” says Green.

BabySeq is, at best, a pilot study. When it’s over, scientists might then be able to launch a full-blown study with 10,000 babies and start seeing real results. For now, Green is just happy to move the debate about the ethics of genomic medicine from the abstract to the physical. “We’ll be grappling with them in real life, with real babies and real families and real clinicians and real laboratory results,” says Green.

It might sound odd to hear Green savoring the prospect of real lab results. But that’s the first step in a huge challenge—communicating the results of genome sequencing—one that BabySeq may help overcome. The data from a genome can be overwhelming, ambiguous, confusing, and upsetting all at once. The BabySeq team will be working on ways to distill the results into reports that are useful for doctors who aren’t trained as genome experts.

“We don’t even have a process in place for how your doctors starts to use information from your genome,” says Green. And the question about what to tell parents will be even more challenging. “What happens when a family says, ‘I’d like to have the hard drive’?” asks Green. “I think that’s something we’ll have to figure out.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0000507-26ca382a9fe6fb183d611ec7fd999182.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007416 00000000000 015131  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The payments industry has been waiting for years for Amazon, with its 215 million credit cards on file, to flex its muscles. Apparently, CEO Jeff Bezos has been, too.

Industry sources have recently told Re/code that Bezos has identified payments as one of the top areas of focus and investment for Amazon, and Amazon payments boss Tom Taylor acknowledged as much in a interview last week at the company’s Seattle headquarters.

“Jeff’s told us it’s something we need to be successful in, and should be successful in,” Taylor said.

“The pressure I feel from Jeff is, ‘Go faster,'” he added.

Amazon has been working for years to try to take advantage of its massive database of customer payment information. One way it has attempted to do this is by pitching other commerce sites on the idea of letting their customers buy products and services from them using payment and shipping information the customers have stored with Amazon. Amazon, in turn, takes a fee on each of those purchases.

It has also pitched a product that allows other online businesses to keep a digital record of who visits their site by letting those visitors use their log-in information from Amazon to sign in rather than having to fill out an annoying amount of new information.

Amazon eventually combined the two products into one, called Login and Pay With Amazon, which it launched last fall. While Amazon says it has thousands of sites using the product, the Gogo inflight Internet service is one of the few big names on the customer list.

Industry observers believe that’s because Amazon now competes with so many different types of online businesses that would never want Amazon seeing data about their sales. But Taylor said that concern is overblown, in part because the Login and Pay product does not allow Amazon to get details of the exact products purchased on the partner sites; a separate Checkout product, which also includes virtual shopping-cart software that handles tax calculations and the like, does.

“There is some aspect in the press of, ‘of course nobody uses Amazon [payments], because they’re afraid of you,'” Taylor said. “But those people we think of as competitors don’t have a payments problem.”

Re/code also reported earlier this year that Amazon is planning to offer payments and point-of-sale systems to physical retailers, which would potentially run on Kindle tablet computers.

Taylor would not confirm or deny the report when asked about it last week.

“More to come. Stay tuned,” he said.

Industry observers and competitors have also been waiting for Amazon to make a move in the competitive, but still underperforming, mobile wallet wars. But if Taylor’s comments are any indication, they may have to keep waiting.

The payments chief expressed skepticism that current mobile payment options for in-store purchases solve any real problems for shoppers. That said, Taylor said Amazon is looking at other offline commerce transactions where paying by phone would alleviate customer frustrations.

In one hypothetical example, drivers would use an Amazon mobile payment product to pay for parking. In another, a diner could use an Amazon payments product to pay for a meal in a restaurant with their phone.

“Where we see those pain points, we’ll focus our attention,” he said.

As for another hot category, peer-to-peer money transfers, many people would be surprised to learn that Amazon already offers a peer-to-peer payment feature similar to PayPal’s. I know I was.

“It’s not a significant part of the business,” Taylor said, “and we haven’t really promoted it.”

Why is that? I asked.

“We’re not sure we’re doing anything better than anyone else,” he said plainly. If and when we think that has changed, he said, “we’ll emphasize it.”

The boss is waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0000412-7239f7f2301e397172093d4fdd41843a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004762 00000000000 014611  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Statement from the Crown Prosecution Service:

“We have considered files of evidence from 14 police forces in respect of allegations relating to Conservative Party candidates’ expenditure during the 2015 General Election campaign.

“We considered whether candidates and election agents working in constituencies that were visited by the Party’s ‘Battle Bus’ may have committed a criminal offence by not declaring related expenditure on their local returns. Instead, as the Electoral Commission found in its report, these costs were recorded as national expenditure by the Party.

“We reviewed the files in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and have concluded the tests in the Code are not met and no criminal charges have been authorised.

“Under the Representation of the People Act, every candidate and agent must sign a declaration on the expenses return that to the best of their knowledge and belief it is a complete and correct return as required by law. It is an offence to knowingly make a false declaration. In order to bring a charge, it must be proved that a suspect knew the return was inaccurate and acted dishonestly in signing the declaration. Although there is evidence to suggest the returns may have been inaccurate, there is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard that any candidate or agent was dishonest.

“The Act also makes it a technical offence for an election agent to fail to deliver a true return. By omitting any ‘Battle Bus’ costs, the returns may have been inaccurate. However, it is clear agents were told by Conservative Party headquarters that the costs were part of the national campaign and it would not be possible to prove any agent acted knowingly or dishonestly. Therefore we have concluded it is not in the public interest to charge anyone referred to us with this offence.

“Our evaluation of the evidence is consistent with that of the Electoral Commission. While the role of the Commission is to regulate political finances and campaign spending, the role of the CPS is to consider whether any individual should face criminal charges, which is a different matter with different consideration and tests.

“One file, from Kent Police, was only recently received by the CPS, and remains under consideration. No inference as to whether any criminal charge may or may not be authorised in relation to this file should be drawn from this fact and we will announce our decision as soon as possible once we have considered the evidence in this matter.”              0000438-4fdff5ce98bb8f5db348f1d5edbebe2c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000103203 00000000000 015720  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        I try not to rely on an article’s title too much to dictate the title I use for myself because it can often come off as lazy.

…But then when did that ever stop me?

So here we have a fairly extensive and interesting look at work by Michael D. Yates at truthout. It was shared by a fan of the site named Joel a few months back and I’m finally getting around to it. It’s got a lot of interesting information and arguments in it and it takes a few turns that I didn’t expect that I’ll take some time to respond to.

One thing I want to say at the outset is that the word “clopening” is stupid.

Apparently someone thought that the practice of forcing your employees to close a shift and then open the next day should just be some sort of ridiculous portmanteau. And likely one that your friends would come up with and think they’re being clever while they’re stoned on some really shitty mushrooms or something.

But it’s not clever and it’s just called being an asshole.

That’s really all there is to it. We don’t need to create ridiculous words to call people assholes and we certainly don’t need to do it when there’s better ways to do it than this. It’s like people who use the word “virtue signaling” when they could just say “showing off”. Saying “virtue signaling” just becomes it’s own virtue signaling after a certain amount of time.

Anyways, Yates has put together a heft read and so I’ll divide this up accordingly.

I: “Clopening” or Being an Asshole

As mentioned before Yates picks out a few phenomenons within the current economy that he finds particularly egregious and I can’t argue with the idea that overworking employees is certainly up there.

What does management do to justify this practice?

Management justifies the practice by claiming that turnover in restaurant and other service jobs is so high that only the relatively few longer-term employees are sufficiently trustworthy and “have the authority and experience to close at night and open in the morning.” Labor advocates say that the reason for clopening is that scheduling is often no longer done by actual managers but by “sophisticated software” purchased by companies.

Surprisingly Yates says that both of these explanations don’t suffice.

Now, I expected Yates to call bullshit on the first but it struck me that he doesn’t think the labor-side of the explanation doesn’t work either. Yates quickly explains that the first one puts the (implicitly) unfair blame on the employees and moves on but I’d like to go a bit deeper and take it further apart.

With that said, the idea that those who are “longer-term” are the only ones who are trustworthycreates an informal hierarchy based on seniority. This in turn can create unintended consequences such as informal power relations between people who have been there longer and those who haven’t. It also can sow distrust between workers and management as well as between the workers themselves.

So even if the blame on the workers was fair it would still have some fairly negative consequences worth considering. But the other problem here is that the management is basically punishing the workers for just getting there. From the moment they officially step into the buildings as actual employees they are punished for not having a time machine and speeding things up. Which also means that they’re liable to feel like criminals and a few of these employees may even act it out.

That sort of phenomenon, for those curious, is referred to as a stereotype threat.

It’s also important to remember that the labeling theory explains why people often feel like they have to act out what others label themselves as. This can have weird internal pressures where if I’m not doing everything I can in a day to slack off or to live up to my anti-work theory then I’m somehow a failure. This is the “imposter syndrome” for being a slacker instead of a hard worker, I suppose. And if it’s not obvious, neither of these imposter syndromes are healthy.

Of course, creating distrust, informal (and formal) hierarchies and treating their employees are implied criminals are all parts of many different industries. So I’m not suggesting the management is doing anything particularly surprising here because it’s not very surprising at all. But it’s also worth exploring a bit more than simply pointing out the victim-blaming logic of employers. Because that’s a fairly basic argument that can just easily turned around by saying, “Well of course I am going to blame the employees. What else would I do?” To me, actually criticizing the effects of these policies and approaches to management seems to me to be a much more effective way to grapple with this issue.

Here’s a point by Yates that is interesting though I think he could just as easily be incorrect:

When shifts consist of people who have been on the job for many years, their loyalty to one another might come to outstrip their corporate fidelity, making them more willing to act collectively in opposition to their supervisors. They are more likely to insist on better treatment and to organize a union when demands are not met.

This could be true but why does Yates presume this?

It could also just be the case that some of these employees develop a sort of Stockholm Syndrome about their employers and the brown-nosers are all what’s left. Or that there’s still a few rebels at heart but their overrun by the brown-nosers. I don’t see why we should presume that these workers are necessarily going to develop some sort of bond when it could jut as easily go another way. The worn out look I’ve seen on some long-term employees wouldn’t indicate that they’re interested in showing solidarity so much as they’re interested in showing up to bed at night.

Let’s look at Yate’s treatment of the labor-side justification for overworking employees:

The second justification suggests that scheduling software is bought to lessen the burden of those who previously had to make work timetables. On the contrary, this software is used by corporations to squeeze as much work out of the mass of employees hired as possible. The goal is to minimize unit labor costs and to achieve maximum control over the labor process, which encompasses every aspect of how work is performed.(1) Workers are conceptualized as mechanical cogs in a system that transforms inputs into outputs, and a host of managerial control techniques are implemented to force those hired to perform what they are ordered to do in a machine-like fashion.

A lot of what Yates is saying here is suggestive of the routine-orientated work that we recently discussed via John Danaher and David Autor. It also relates to the individualist anarchist critique of work which states that this collectivization of workers into mechanical cogs is a deeply anti-individualist approach for labor. If we want to reclaim our lives from the oppressive hold that work has on us then we’ll need to start by reclaiming our own individual identities first.

The “outputs” and “inputs” that Yates discusses here is the sort of collectivizing abstraction that manages put individual workers under so that they can (likely) feel better about the control they are enforcing. If we just think of people as a means to an ends then we don’t need to worry about the individuals themselves. We’ve subsumed these individuals under useful cognitive shortcuts that, as managers, allows us to exploit them that much easily.

None of this is to say that technology or cognitive shortcuts are bad things in of themselves. But under the use of capitalism and especially state-capitalism it’s a dangerous combination of unjustified power and oppressive systematic constraints. And so the fact that capitalism uses this technology isn’t a statement so much about technology as so much who (or what) is making use of it. I’m not sure that Yates would disagree but I wanted to make that explicit.

Interestingly, Yates mentions the just-in-time inventory process:

An important modern control device is just-in-time inventory, meaning that a business keeps only as much inventory – car seats in an auto plant, frozen French fries in a fast-food restaurant – as will be needed over a very short period of time.

This actually makes the system more vulnerable to the actions of radical unions, as Kevin Carson has written:

Absent the restrictions of the Wagner and Taft-Hartley labor regime, today’s “just-in-time” economy would likely be far more vulnerable to such disruption than that of the 1930s. Prominent labor journalist Jane Slaughter argued as much: “Just-in-time”… has made the union potentially more powerful than ever. The lack of buffer stocks makes

with labor power—if workers in a department refuse to work, management has no extras to replace them. Action by even a few members could affect production drastically.” A British management consultant warned, in similar terms, about the vulnerability of just-in-time to disruption: “Without buffer stocks between production each process is entirely dependent on the upstream one to deliver. Hence JIT bestows upon those who work it the capacity to create disruptions which, intentionally or otherwise are likely to be extremely pervasive….A mere refusal to work overtime or to be flexible about tea breaks and working practices could cause severe problems, and a work-to-rule or stoppage could be disastrous…. The ideal JIT system has no inventories, no buffer stock, and no stocks of finished goods.If the supplier fails to deliver, production stops; if any one process fails to deliver, production stops; and if transport fails, production stops.” (p. 4)

Of course, I doubt Yates is advocating for the Industrial Workers of the World to start going full force after JIT but it’s a point worth making that the problems he’s pointing out could be exploited for our own benefit.

Yates goes further to explain how this JIT system applies to workers and how many hours they get for the week based on the demands of the products within a very short time-span. This puts more pressure for some workers to agree on “on-call” shifts where they do something as ridiculous as come in for a grand total of two hours before leaving.

II: “Management by stress”

Yates conjectures that the slow rise of the employment in the US has to do with how much workers have been exploited and how this exploitation is only rising and becoming worse. Which brings to mind the problem with outlets like truthout which is that they sometimes rely on ideology more than data. So, for example, Yates makes a claim here that seems rather intuitively plausible but rests on this intuition alone without using any sort of empirical data.

The point here isn’t to deny Yates basic point that workers are being exploited and in many objectionable ways. But rather the point is that if he is going to try to make claims about the economy he may want to rely on something more than ideological claims that will appeal to his audience, some of whom I assume are less sympathetic than I am.

In any case, Yates has an interesting term for these sorts of control:

Some have called the new forms of control, “management by stress,” meaning that employers constantly stress the labor process to force more production out of less labor. (2) In economic terms, every second counts, and eliminating a fraction of a second from the performance of a particular job detail means a great deal of money when applied to tens of millions of repetitions.(3) So, speed up the assembly line and keep inventory, including labor, low. Reduce the size of work teams – but keep raising the output quota; outsource work to lower-wage countries; and super-exploit undocumented immigrants. Threaten those who can’t keep up with demotion or firing; engage in constant electronic monitoring of employees on the job; even, as Henry Ford once did, keep tabs on the worker’s private lives, which today often means eavesdropping on their Facebook and Twitter posts.

I’ve tackled the negative effects of work on our health many times over (most recently here) and I’ve also denoted the spying that employers can do on employees via the folks at Stuff You Should Know. But what’s commendable and noteworthy here is how Yates combines a lot of these individual strands I’ve been picking at before and puts them under a fairly intuitive (read not “clopener”) title of “management by stress” which I’d never heard before.

This is a fantastic phrase not just because it’s easy to remember and say but it really cuts at the heart of many of the issues with work today. Workers are constantly over-stressed by employers who gives them too much to do with inadequate tools and all while paying them too little. This isn’t even mentioning the lack of health benefits that part-time employees especially have and sometimes even full-time employees get the short end of the stick here.

And of course all of this pressure affects us with our sleep and our ability to do other things besides work. Which turn becomes evidence for this offensive argument against working less. Because after all, what do people do when they’re not working? They’re trying to rest from work! So let’s make them work more and that will somehow solve the problem!

But this misses the fact that work is such a privileged activity in this society and acts as a sort of conduit for much of the corrupt society that we live in today. And when people can finally get away from that of course they’re more likely to just fall asleep on their couch while watching reruns of some show they don’t even care about. Of course people eat a lot of fast food instead of preparing home cooked meals that may mesh better with their preferred eating habits.

That last example, for the record, isn’t to shame folks who eat fast food. If you enjoy it then all of the power to you. But I suspect there are many less people who would eat it and watch reruns of shows they don’t even like if we had more time for ourselves and less time indebted to state-capitalism.

To his credit, Yates notices this as well though on a different angle or two:

Without adequate sleep, our mental functions are impaired, making it more difficult to comprehend what we are reading or what others are saying. We have little time and energy for meaningful social interactions, and as a consequence, family life can break down, and we are discouraged from developing political awareness and participating in groups that benefit workers, such as labor unions and campaigns to improve wages, hours and conditions of employment, the very things that could stop or radically diminish on-the-job stress.

I want to add however that unions are hardly the only way to radically diminish on-the-job stress. I was able to reduce much of the stress I had at jobs by not giving a shit. Which isn’t doable for all of us but if you think it’s possible for you to care less about your job so that it’ll take less energy from you then you should do it. And you should especially do it if you can still produce the level of outputs that your employer expects…or at least somewhere in the ballpark.

The next quote was the signature quote for Joel:

When we combine relentless time pressure with the mind-numbing and physically destructive nature of most jobs, we have a recipe for acute human misery.

It’s a good quote indeed but also sadly where the article plateaus.

III: Potential Remedies (and Poison)

As with many anti-work articles of a liberal sort, the article comes up short when it comes to solutions.

But I want to take the good points for what their worth (which isn’t trivial) and focus on that first.

Plus, they come chronologically anyhow.

Yates is surprisingly realistic about the potential for modern day unions acting within a state-controlled context:

…[U]nions cannot effectively combat “management by stress,” in all of its dimensions, until they abandon the labor-management cooperation strategy that still has a stranglehold on them. Rather than confront employers, cooperating unions like the United Autoworkers have large cadres of union staff people who actually help the companies stress the workers. … …[W]ith union density in the United States as low as it was 100 years ago, labor will have a difficult time getting states to enact a similar law, especially with its general unwillingness to politically mobilize members to confront legislators.

The understanding that labor unions of any merit are in a short supply isn’t something many liberals tend to understand. So I certainly have to give props to Yates for being politically aware enough to realize that the Powers That Be would likely never listen to a union about making radical reforms to a system that heavily benefits them.

Unlike many writers, Yates seems to understand that the folks who make the law are still people and not unicorns. They’re not whatever we want them or imagine them to be. We can try to pretend that they won’t listen to the incentives of the people who lobby for the laws that keep them both in power, but the reality of the situation is much different.

Instead, we have to admit to ourselves that most labor unions today are not radical and not usually willing to fight the government on their own (the union’s that is) terms. If they want to fight within the regulatory framework of the state then they’re going to have to play by all of the rules that the ruling elite has much more control over then the unions do.

And even those unions who have decided to make deals with their local or state governments will still likely have to go through a bunch of hoops and rules just so they can stay afloat. There’s likely no way that union members who are already highly stressed out by work are also going to be able to take on the federal government.

So again, I’m grateful to Yates for at least (sort of) getting all of that.

Employers have their own solution. Do nothing. They argue that businesses will voluntarily address workplace problems when the market sends them signals that this is what employees want.

Funnily enough, I think this is a much better strategy for the employees than the employers.

Surely Yates is familiar with slow-downs, right?

Perhaps even more impressively Yates takes aim market regulation as a potential (but failed) remedy:

This is envisioned as a combination of labor union organization and agitation and political initiatives. In both cases, labor and other markets are taken as given (inevitable), and the only possibility is to set certain parameters, or limits, as to what market results are allowed to prevail. … This strategy has had some success in the past, but today it hasn’t yielded much for wage laborers.

The fact that Yates recognizes this is something I’ve been dying to see a liberal commentator acknowledge for the longest time and I’m so glad I’m finally seeing it. It’s likely fair to claim that there’s been “some success” in the past but even that success (if I may make the “perfect the enemy of the good” for a second) was mitigated by prevailing interests of capital, the state and Big Labor (i.e. state-collaborative unions).

I don’t have the time or interest to rebut Yates historical narrative of reforms however. For the sake of argument I’ll grant him that many of the things that liberals have fought and won for could be non-controversially described as “gains”.

Yates is at his best when he becomes the most “pessimistic” (realistic):

Unfortunately, all of these gains have steadily eroded as employers regained the initiative in the mid-1970s and launched the ferocious neoliberal austerity that has dominated the United States ever since. Unions were caught unprepared and responded in a defeatist, defensive way, while their liberal allies deserted them. Labor leaders began to give employees dramatic concessions, and today givebacks have become so prevalent that it is an open question why a rational person would join a union. Strikes are remembered today mainly by retirees. Nothing much can be expected of government, where the level of corruption is so great and the hold of our corporate overlords so strong that we believe we have achieved a remarkable victory when the government doesn’t take something away from us. (emphasis added)

For the record, I disagree with this particular narrative of power. I don’t thnik that “corporate overloads’ is the right term for them because they’re more likely partners and specifically with the state.

Consider Roderick Long’s formulation in Remembering Corporate Liberalism:

The main plotline of the Star Wars prequel trilogy concerns an apparent conflict between the central government (the Senate) on the one hand and a coalition of mercantile interests (the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guild, etc.) on the other. As events unfold, however, it quickly becomes obvious to the audience (though much less quickly to the protagonists) that the conflict is largely a ruse, with the leadership of the two sides (Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku, respectively) secretly working hand in glove. Which isn’t to say that all is rosy between them. Each wants to be the dominant partner; witness Dooku’s failed attempt to betray Palpatine in Episode II, and Palpatine’s successful backstabbing of Dooku and his corporate allies in Episode III. Still, the partnership is stable enough to succeed in manipulating the protagonists into unwittingly undermining the very liberty they have been seeking to protect. As the pseudo-conflict escalates, there are, in the words of Episode III’s opening crawl, “heroes on both sides” – but the good guys on the two sides have been duped into fighting one another, each side grasping the evil of the other side’s leadership but not yet that of its own.

Now…I have many thoughts about the Star Wars prequels (most of them negative) but we’ll put that to the side.

Regardless, I see Long’s power analysis as much more accurate than seeing the corporations as having total control over the economy. But even with that said, Yates is surely more correct than many of his other contemporaries when it comes to assessing the odds of affecting change.

But still…it could use some improvement:

The unhappy truth is that we can never beat those who own the world’s capital at their own game. They rule the marketplace, and we do not; the government of almost every nation exists to aid and abet them; and the control over the billions of property-less people in the world grows and deepens every day. Organizing within this hegemonic system while assuming that the market mechanism is inescapable, and being grateful for a few crumbs from its table, is a strategy guaranteed to fail.

It’s certainly true that the capitalist control the marketplace and that governments often try to aid the capitalists but this also works the other way around. If a capitalist cannot appeal to congress or get the right sort of licenses then they’re practically forced to either give up or work underground. If congresspeople don’t like the capitalist or if the laws are simply too risky or costly to work through then the given capitalist becomes dependent on the mercy of lawmakers.

I’m not trying to point a sympathetic case for the capitalist (and obviously upper class ones are less likely to have these issues) but to just point out the sort of mutuality of this oppressive system. It’s true that capitalists tend to lobby for regulations that benefit them and this has been well documented by many historians such as Gabriel Kolko.

But this relation isn’t a one-way street.

Sometimes corporations need the government to get certain permits or restrictions lifted. Other times corporations need to renew their legal agreements with local courts over their corporate body. And there have been plenty of times that corporations and governments have gone to court over a struggle for power.

All of this is just to say that the marketplace needs to be fought on both anti-corporate, anti-capitalist and anti-state grounds because without all of these reasons our battle for liberation will be woefully incomplete.

Unfortunately, this is where Yates ends up in his analysis: Woefully incomplete

The market is nothing more than a surface phenomenon, behind which lies the critical social relationship of unequal power, which means that focusing our efforts solely on regulation of the market ignores what is fundamental. So perhaps instead, we should make demands and take actions that threaten the market, that is, by directly attacking the power of those who are its masters and not accepting arrangements that allow the system to absorb our efforts and continue much as before. In addition, because the market is enveloped by an array of institutions – the state, media, schools – that buttress the power of those who control it, efforts to radically alter society must aim to change these as well.

To me, this pattern of thought seems to almost connect the state and the market but seems to treat the market itself as some sort of enemy. To me this is misguided because it isn’t marketplaces themselves that we should oppose as anti-work theorists because capitalists are the ones who dominate the marketplaces, not workers or individuals.

The second problem I’d highlight with this passage is that we have to “radically … change” these positions of power instead of abolishing them. I don’t want some nicer masters of the markets, I want no masters at all. But Yates seems to think we can somehow (in spite of his realism previously) that we can do better even with the same incentives in place.

IV: Conclusion

Yates ends up calling for some sort of general principles and commitments which includes many laudable goals such as abolishing the prison system, ending corporate subsidies and open borders, just to name a few! These and some of the other goals are (to a lesser extent) also laudable such as free universal healthcare, community policing and disestablishing the link between work and income.

The first could be done in an anarchist way and so could the second while the third likely implies some sort of universal basic income based on a government. Which would also explain things like “free schooling” and “banning” certain profit-making practices that harm the environment, etc.

To be honest though, the proposal is just a mess.

What individuals and organizations would sign on to this? What would be the end result of it? What government would ever end corporate subsidies and open its borders? Are people creating small enclaves that are acting out these principles and commitments on their own terms? Why would the government allow any of that to happen?

This “strategy” is so muddled that it’s unclear exactly what the point of any of this would be. To send a message to governments? But why would they listen, much less do anything about it? And is there such strong popular demand for all if any of these demands? If Yates knows something I don’t know, then they better be willing to share with the class.

Yates gives us some specifics, some of which I appreciate more than others:

The commitments could embrace as many forms of collective self-help as imaginable (Cuban-style urban organic farming, cooperatives dedicated to education, child care, health, food provision, the establishment of worker-controlled enterprises); a shedding of excessive unnecessary possessions; a willingness to offer material support to local struggles aimed at empowering those without voice; a refusal to join the military or participate in the mindless and dangerous patriotism so prevalent in the United States; and a promise to educate ourselves and others about the nature of the system in whatever venues present themselves to us.

As I said before, I think our emphasis on liberation from work should be rooted in individualist ethics so situating these struggles around “collective” self-help is more of a hindrance than a help. That isn’t to say that I have anything against cooperatives or worker-controlled enterprises because I don’t. I thnik both of these things are very important for the development of a new society that actually bases its success around the individual and not in spite of it.

But there are things in here that point to disregarding such a metric.

To take some examples: What decides what are “excessive” amounts of things that we own? Who is to decide what possessions are “unnecessary”? Should we take away the stamp collectors stamps because they aren’t “socially useful” to the broader community? Should we decide that someone’s collection of family heirlooms shouldn’t be held because they only “selfishly” do something for that family or a particular individual in that family?

I’m not asking these questions because I thnik Yates or folks like him want to take away the stamps or the family heirlooms but because these are questions that should be considered. Who or what dictates what is “socially useful”, “unnecessary” and “excessive”? Is it the community? A government? An organization that might as well be one?

Regardless of Yate’s answer, I doubt it will be satisfying to me. I don’t think anyone’s possessions should be regulated by the very slippery metric of what constitutes “socially useful”. Certainly, the “transfer of abandoned buildings and land to communities and groups who will put them to socially useful purposes” isn’t a very fair metric for those who can hardly contribute to it physically or mentally. This raises questions of also considering disability as well as class, which I think Yate’s analysis sometimes ignores and liberals in general tend to ignore.

Though, for what it’s worth Yates is a very good liberal. He’s probbly better described alongside radical liberals like Howard Zinn and (this will get me in trouble) Noam Chomsky. Both of whom I have much respect for but wouldn’t say that they are without their flaws. And certainly Yate and I have very similar values and objectives in a lot of ways and I think his article points out many huge issues with working. But his solutions to these problems and even some of his analysis of the root issues are too caught up in anti-market ideas to prove as useful as possible.

There’s a sort of degradation of the anti-work critique I’ve seen over time as more and more liberal groups decide it’s a popular thing to write about or have someone write about it. But the critique eventually becomes muddled by the fact that the commentators don’t understand that the state isn’t something that can be reconciled with their critiques.

Though, to Yates credit he certainly gets the closest to this understanding. My guess is that he would admit this is true for the capitalist-controlled state but thinks we can move towards the liberal notion of the neutral state.

Yates list some “ancillary ideas” that I’ll briefly address:

FIRST, the details of these will naturally flow out of the specifics of actual events and struggles around them SECOND, whatever relatively small or local changes we fight for should always be connected to the larger and more global principles. THIRD, commitments should be part of a social process, in which we pledge ourselves to come to the aid of others. FOURTH, democratic, critical education is essential in all battles for radical social reconstruction. (edited for brevity)

All of these are interesting ideas and Yates was kind enough to give us some examples alongside the way for most of these things. But again, I want to point out that the third point Yates makes us all committed to each other in some sort of bizarre system that compels us to help each other. If he isn’t talking about compulsion in some physical sense he may as well be given his interest in having us pledge ourselves to each other and make “promises”.

And I don’t dislike such things because I thnik we should only take care of ourselves but because these sorts of social ties actually hurt communities more than they help it. Promises are a really hard thing to make and an even harder thing to keep because life is fucking crazy and you better damn well make sure you can keep your promise.

Promises are a big cultural signal and they are deservedly taken as seriously as they are currently. But they’re certainly not a stable or sustainable way to maintain a community given how badly the failure to uphold a promise can harm others and how personally folks can take it.

But even if that wasn’t true it still seems heavily unfair to make everyone “understand” each others oppression in the same way and using the same method. Not everyone can do the same things as everyone else and often that has to do with our own individual limits, character and abilities. I feel like Yates isn’t taking this enough into account.

Yates also makes this claim further down that, “We live in an age of disposability. The drive to make money has now engulfed every part of the world and every aspect of our lives.” But I’d contest it isn’t the drive to make money that is inherently bad but rather how we use this drive. If we’re using this drive as an excuse to treat other folks as a means to an end then that’s surely an unfortunate thing. But just as with technology and capitalism, the latter doesn’t necessarily say much about the former except that under certain incentive structures the former will behave in negative ways.

I think my basic point is that he comes so damn close to anarchism but doesn’t seem to go through with it.

And for the life of me I just can’t figure out why.

Because by the time you’re calling for the military to retreat from the Middle East, opening the borders, ending corporate subsidies and ending the prison system then you may as well be an anarchist to most people anyways!

And avoiding this inevitable conclusion of a robust anti-work critique doesn’t help, it hinders.

To offer a calmer shopping environment the stores will have their lights dimmed and the quantity of fluorescent lighting reduced.

There will be no in-store music or Tannoy announcements for the duration of the event, autism-friendly signage will be put in place, and stores will be providing quiet zones.

“Holding such events has given our teams extreme pride in reaching out to autism groups within the community,” said Toys R Us marketing director Mike Coogan.

“Making slight adjustments to stores and creating a quiet shopping period allows children and young adults to experience the fun in a toy shop, regardless of their disability.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0000585-7a7ba9c89e5486d9ac0bf4f8aae4e311.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005232 00000000000 015341  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Denmark tightened border controls with Germany on Monday soon after Sweden introduced identity checks for travelers arriving from Denmark in an attempt to limit the flow of migrants.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- Denmark tightened border controls with Germany on Monday soon after Sweden introduced identity checks for travelers arriving from Denmark in an attempt to limit the flow of migrants.

Danish police will carry out border inspections for the next 10 days. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said the decision was "not a happy moment," but added Denmark "must respond" to Sweden's move, BBC News reports.

"We are introducing temporary border controls, but in a balanced way," Rasmussen said. "If the European Union cannot protect the external border you will see more and more countries forced to introduce temporary border controls."

The Danish restrictions may extend to all of the country's borders.

The Swedish border controls will be imposed on the Öresund Bridge, which connects Sweden and Denmark. All people traveling via train or bus through the bridge or by using ferry services will be denied entry without proper documentation.

About 20,000 people commute through the Öresund Bridge daily. Train commuters heading to Sweden will also have to change rails at the Copenhagen Airport and go through identity checkpoints. The new identity checks are expected to create significant delays.

Swedish Infrastructure Minister Anna Johansson said the new rules would be changed if there was a dramatic fall in the number of asylum seekers. The border control introduction reverses Sweden's open border policy that had been in place since the 1950s.

More than 1 million migrants entered Europe in 2015, creating a humanitarian crisis as some countries struggled to cope with the large number of asylum-seekers.

Late last year, Sweden introduced a new law that would fine transport companies nearly $6,000 if travelers to Sweden do not have a valid photo ID.

Danish Transport Minister Hans Christian Schmidt said the introduction of border checks was sad and "extremely annoying," suggesting the Swedish government should pay for the checks -- estimated to cost about $145,000 daily.

Sweden, with a population of 9.8 million, received more than 150,000 asylum applications in 2015, a higher number per capita than any other country in the European Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000279-ac3869558a02f09fc3c3a17d9bd9105c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004702 00000000000 015111  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A man holds a Kurdish flag with a picture of Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani during a gathering to support next week's referendum in Iraq, at Martyrs Square in Downtown Beirut, Lebanon, Sunday, Se

Iraq's vice president said on Sunday that his country “will not allow the creation of a second Israel in northern Iraq," in a reference to the Kurdish attempt to gain independence, a pro-Kurdish news site Rudaw reported Monday.

Iraq's Vice President Nouri al-Maliki made the comments to U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Douglas Sliman.

Ahead of the September 25 referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq, a measure opposed by Iraqi lawmakers, Netanyahu declared his support for "the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve a state of their own," making Israel the only country to support the establishment of an independent Kurdistan.

Following Netanyahu's support for Kurdish national efforts, pro-government newspapers in Turkey falsely reported an alleged deal to settle 2000,000 Kurdish Jews in the newly independent Kurdistan, as Turkey ramped ups its warnings against a "yes" vote in the upcoming referendum.

The re-settlement plan, the false reports claimed, was hatched by Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani. A pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Sefak wrote that Barzani "received support only from Israel during the referendum process" and will utilize "help from Kurds of Jewish origin."

Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, viewing the minority ethnic group - whose indigenous population is split between Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran - as a buffer against shared Arab adversaries.

Developer Quantic Dream is run by a man named David Cage, and as anyone even remotely familiar with the studio knows, Cage takes his job very seriously. His upcoming PlayStation 3 exclusive title Beyond: Two Souls is another game in his company’s newly-minted genre – Interactive Drama – and to prove just how humongous and dense the game is, Sony sent out a mock script representing every scene in the game.

Dan Ackerman from CNET posted a picture of said script on Facebook. He notes that each of the pages are completely blank, so don’t flip out… that’s not the actual script. It’s simply representative of the game’s meatiness.

Beyond: Two Souls launches on PS3 in October. In the meantime, check out the game’s box art and read our hands-on preview of the game.

Mr Aamer, an aid worker, was sold to the Americans 13 years ago in Afghanistan, where he was living with his family.

He was cleared for release in 2007 and again in 2009 by the most senior levels of US intelligence and military. Our prime minister has asked for his return to the UK. Successive foreign secretaries have assured his family and lawyers that they are doing everything to get him back. It is absolutely unacceptable that an innocent man who has suffered many of the forms of torture now made public by the Senate can continue to be held in Guantánamo Bay.

Our group has MPs from eight political parties, representing a broad section of UK public opinion, calling for Mr Aamer’s immediate release from a place where his torture continues. The group is committed to active engagement with the US authorities for Mr Aamer’s return home. His continued detention shames our society.

At first, all Gregory Sutton really wanted to know was why flowers looked so different.

He was "naive," the University of Bristol biologist told the Christian Science Monitor. He didn't know then that the question would launch him on a years-long quest to understand the invisible interaction between flowers and the bees that pollinate them.

It turned out that flowers develop varied sizes and shapes in order to force bees into a monogamous relationship with them — since the insects have to invest a lot of time in learning how to extract nectar, once they figure out how to do so they're reluctant to keep flying around. But even more surprising was how bees are able to tell what kind of flower they're looking at.

In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, Sutton reported that the fuzz that covers bees' bodies helps the tiny critters sense flowers' natural electric fields, allowing them to home in on their favorite plants to pollinate.

"The bumblebees can feel that hair bend and use that feeling to tell the difference between flowers," Sutton told NPR.

[Sharks' electricity-sensing organs are even more powerful than we realized]

The 2013 discovery that bees can sense electric fields came as a surprise to Sutton and his colleagues. Though lots of creatures have that ability — sharks, eels, platypuses — they all need to be in water to use it. But the bees that the British researchers studied seemed able to discern minute fluctuations in the electric charge of an artificial flower (flowers generate a faint electric field through their interactions with the earth and air around them), which helped them track down the sweet treats at the bottom. They could also sense the natural changes in charge emitted by petunias. Indeed, bees could tell when the charge of a flower had been altered by another bee landing on it.

But how did they do it?

Initially, Sutton suspected that the bees were using their antennae. But when he tested that theory, the feelers weren't particularly responsive.

"So, we looked at the big fuzzy hairs on the bumblebees: They're so fuzzy!" Sutton told the Christian Science Monitor.

[Listening for love: How female crickets got so good at hearing their mates]

So fuzzy indeed. Using a laser beam capable of detecting very small motions in the bees' hairs — and a electrode that could record activity in nerve cells at the bottoms of the hairs — they found that the fuzzy strands bent in response to the electric fields, much the same way human hair will stand up when mussed with a balloon. The bee hairs then sent signals to the bees' nervous system, allowing them to sense the electric fields and react accordingly.

"I'm very excited by this because these little mechanically sensitive hairs are common all over the insect world," Sutton told NPR. "I think this might be something we see in more insects than just bumblebees."

Robert Gegear, who studies pollinating insects at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Mass., agrees.

"Basically this just adds to the long list of incredible things that bees can do," he told NPR.

But it's still not clear whether the bees are really using their electric sensors to find the flowers they like, he added. Flowers have plenty of other distinguishing characteristics, and it's possible that the bees rely on the hairs for another purpose entirely — like navigation.

"And so the one question I have is, 'What is the functional relevance?'" Gegear said. "Not just from the bee side but from the plant side as well."

Initially, part of me wanted to reject the comparison as trite and absurd, along with the very notion that something that happened in a comparatively small industry could be held up alongside an event that will impact the lives of every American, and many around the globe.And yet, despite my initial impulse, the connections are undeniably there: I’ve been seeing them for months and just didn’t want to say it out loud, as if my words were a magic spell that might conjure forth a sinewy darkness.As my friend and colleague Dan Golding tweeted , “How depressing, infuriating, and otherworldly it is to realize that video games were the canary in the coal mine for the politics of 2016.” Our experiences navigating cyber-mobs have familiarized us with this particular breed of hate. It’s a deeply entrenched, vitriolic, organized hate. I used to refer to GamerGate as a large-scale temper tantrum, because if the death and rape threats hadn’t been so terrifying, their behavior would be analogous to that of a 2-year-old child not getting the toy he wanted. Trump similarly appealed to deep-seated notions of entitlement and privilege — mixing in fear-mongering, racism, and misogyny through the scapegoating of marginalized people — meanwhile offering no solutions for the real problems facing so many Americans — problems like unemployment, low wages, a lack of health care, restrictions on basic reproductive rights, and police militarization and brutality, among many others.One of the most heartbreaking aspects of GamerGate is that the industry remained silent. As their customers and fans continued to attack women and marginalized people, the major games publishers, developers, and much of the games press refused to acknowledge and condemn the horror that was sweeping through gaming culture. By the time a few of them did speak up, it was too little, too late; so much damage had already been done.Much of the same could be said for our current politicians, many of whom are acting as if Trump’s rhetoric is simply politics as usual, when everyone in this country knows it isn’t. His racist tirades are the stuff of fascism. His boasts about sexual assault are anything but lighthearted “locker room talk.”Since the dawn of the internet we’ve been lamenting, celebrating, blaming, rejoicing, thanking and criticizing our hyper connected culture for quite literally everything. The elections went well because of the internet; the elections went poorly because of the internet. Kids have short attention spans because of the internet; underrepresented communities have a voice because of the internet. People get harassed because of the internet; people can organize against harassment because of the internet. And now, of course, fake news circulates because of the internet.Technology is not neutral. It can be used to advance social justice or to promote oppression and maintain the status quo. Many of us have been fighting for years to create safer online spaces. We’ve been working to create a large-scale cultural shift where all people are free to engage and participate in our online world without fear of threats, intimidation, or harassment. But when the President-elect of the United States is someone who regularly uses Twitter to attack everyone from his political opponents, to journalists who are critical of him, to other global powers, what intensely contradictory messages are being sent?Trump, much like the figureheads of GamerGate, often skirts the Terms of Service of social media sites to avoid being banned. Rather than spewing explicit threats himself, his words incite and encourage unpredictable hate from his followers. Within moments of the election results we saw a spike in hate crimes across the country; just a month after election day there were already 1,094 reported hate crimes in the United States. Think of how many go unreported.And let us not delude ourselves into thinking that the only problem with hate speech is the manifestation of physical violence that follows: Hateful discourse in the social sphere represents its own form of violence. Progressive activists and scholars have long documented the emotional and mental effects of this kind of aggression. It is not an exaggeration to say that the continual denial of one’s humanity, of one’s right to live and exist safely, enacts a tangible punishment upon the recipient. While some people who post hate and threats on social media may never intend to act on their threats, they do intend to make the recipients fearful. And sometimes, through the sheer weight of their numbers and the awful intensity of their vitriol, they succeed. They don’t need to escalate to physical intimidation. They have achieved their aims merely by typing words on a keyboard.Many people woke up on Nov 9, 2016 feeling horrified, scared, and lost. Uncertain about what to do next, but with a newfound sense of resolve. They’ve been awakened to the fact that progress isn’t a moving sidewalk that carries us all collectively forward on its own, that we have had to fight every day for what little we have earned, and fight even harder to hold onto those gains. As a nation, we have fought enormous battles in the past and this is yet another. I will be in the physical and digital streets, fighting for the humanity and dignity of all people. I hope you will, too.                                                                                                              0000303-5b2dca5404eda86b5e4ff070f339b8c1.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000016256 00000000000 015236  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        This show is really something quite special. The first set starts off with a lively Stranger which follows with a stupendous West LA..maybe the best one they ever played. Jerry teases at Cumberland before they launch into Me & My Uncle then comes a barn burning version. Far from Me is Brent at his best and this version is unique as it is played at a slower tempo. He as well as the rest of the band are at top of their game. Phil as mentioned in earlier reviews steals the show. Jerry breaks out TLEO and has a couple vocal missteps but it is a welcomed return version. The set closing trifica of Cassidy, which is subtle, piercing and expansive, followed by a full out Jerry hoot of Tennessee Jed and then a rocking Promised top off this top level first set. Set two begins with poetic sweet Jerry noodling which lets the devoted know full well that they are in for a excellent second set. They jump into a slower tempo version of Eyes, this one may not start off as strong as other versions from this year but blossoms into a note worthy one. The LL Rain is a perfect as the band really gets romantic on it and passionate, deeply passioante. Jerry follows with a text book perfect reading of Crazy Fingers in which his stellar vocals shine. They launch into a upbeat and intense PITB which transitions into a majestic UJB that concludes with a great PITB reprise. The drums space is typical of this era and is quite enjoyable. You get a moving Wheel which then explodes into a firestorm performance of Miracle, which of coarse Phil steals the show on, and then they drop into what else? You guessed it with Jerry being in the driver's seat, its gotta be Morning Dew and it is a monumental version of this classic. Brent explodes on the B3 and Phil continues to raise the ante with it all coming together in a glorious peak which Jerry just devastates the entire Auzten Stadium audience with. It is very rare that they end a second with this song but this night they did. I believe the last time they had do such was in the fall of 1984. The only blemish, if you can even call it that, is that Phil does not sing one song the entire afternoon...maybe Box of Rain could have been the encore instead? The Hog Farmers had to just wait until the next night for that call. Saturday night rocks out and leaves us wanting more. Once you listen to this show it will, rightly so, make its way on to your favorite shows of all time list. Happy Trails kids.

This concert is the definition of a "Phil Show". Phil plays lead from start to finish - setting the pace for perhaps the best concert of 1990, except maybe the amazing April 1 show at Atlanta's OMNI.



Han more than does justice to flawed SBD and AUD sources; rendering this massive ensemble show in near pristine quality.



More bass than you can believe!



From "West LA" on, the Band is in perfect sync, with voices clear and on key.



NO slurred or skipped words! Only two very minor musical mistakes that I could [barely] catch. Complete lyrics on all songs, in correct order.



Can't wait to get "in the mood" and listen to this, but my sober evaluation follows:



"They Love Each Other" IMHO is the best rendition ever.



Would say the same of Cassidy, except for the severe flaw near the end.



In "Playin' in the Band", Bobby plays slashy, tight chorded leads with Phil as Jerry leads the band out onto a long, think limb of fusion - a limb big enough to accommodate a dance right into Uncle John's Band. Phil and the rhythm section continues to lead as the harmonies return. Bobby's licks are getting louder and better all the time, and again, Phil is joining in on the singing! The timing is simply perfect - everyone on the same page - totally, very rare. Of course, after a long road stand everyone is going to have practised their way into a groove, but something about this show is different. Everyone is really rested sounding and seems to feel extra good. No fatigue, the focus is so damn crisp. As Jerry said once, "When we have a bad night it's OK, and on a good night it's just amazing".



The harmonies in "Uncle John's Band" are better than on the original studio album. The second Jerry solo is monumental; despite the Soundboard dropout near the end. Han covers this admirably, considering the thin quality of the AUD source. Mercifully, this serious SBD flaw is very brief.



Bill and Mickey's "Drums" is unusually aggressive with a yipping dogs/hyenas effect that really fits for some reason. They continue to use this effect, entering "Space" after only a minute or so - with the audience responding individually, and then the bells, chimes, and gongs begin. I hate this term, but it fits here, OMFG... For those who may have become too sedate, this section resurrects all but the literally dead, into the "proper" state of mind. If you don't have great speakers, or live near others, you may want to turn the volume down when this section starts... If you do have great speakers, and some space, turn it UP!



Cannot comment coherently on "Space". You will understand. If this was your first "long strange trip" then I pity you, at least until the end of "Space". But you gotta learn sometime... Brent and Jerry border on sardonic here, with all the help Mickey can provide. The bells and chimes are dimensional. Brent plays with Beethoven's 9th as Jerry does a jazz dance into "The Wheel", and back to reality. All initiates get to come home, with a lesson to take with them. Jerry and Brent sing a duet, backed by Bobby and Phil. Perfect timing, no slop. Singular.



"The Wheel" melts into Bobby's "Miracle", again, a Phil caused speaker warning, simply excellent. Bobby's voice is just pristine all night at this show. Phil really gets front and center on this one. New girlfriend? Something - Phil is just astounding in this show. If you want to study Phil's style, this is the show for you! Phil's exuberance is, IMHO, the key to this show's exceptional energy and tightness. In miracle, Phil plays note for note with Jerry and Bobby steps up and does the same. Bobby's "back lead" on this is as good as Jerry's lead. It sounds like the Allman Brothers as times with three leads trading off.



Finally to end the continuous set, the timeless hymn of the Dead, "Morning Dew". Words cannot describe this rendition, only ears and hearts. Jerry does ALL the lyrics, IN ORDER, PERFECTLY, and beautifully. The power of this piece cannot be overstated. The Band peaks totally, led by Phil. This is a Phil show.



This may be the best Morning Dew ever. I realise what I say here... I've been a Deadhead since 1968 and seen over 300 concerts... IMHO, this IS the best one ever, in terms of power, precision, beauty, and tightness.



Yes, I am one of those who believe The Grateful Dead hit a "second peak" in 1990, after the awesome 1977 season. But this is a different peak, a wise peak, a powerfully mellow peak. The beautiful pinnacle IMHO.



This was an amazing night of all the amazing nights. Hansokolow succeeds in eliminating almost all of the considerable shortcomings in both sources. The result is just wonderful. Thanks Han!



Despite the flaws, and considering the outstanding QUALITY of the performance by ALL band members on this night, I vote 5 stars.

Vice President Mike Pence may soon get to cast his first tie-breaking vote in the Senate.

Two Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – announced Wednesday they will vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary.

If the 50 other Senate Republicans vote today for DeVos, and the 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them oppose her, the Senate would split 50-50.

The vice president gets to break any ties.

Vice President Biden never got that chance. Nor did the last Hoosier vice president, Dan Quayle.

Vice President Cheney, however, broke eight ties.

Pence would likely get particular pleasure in voting for DeVos, a Michigan philanthropist and staunch voucher advocate who played an influential role in developing Indiana’s largest-in-the-nation private school voucher program.

As governor, Mike Pence strongly advocated for education reforms, overseeing a vast expansion of the state’s private school voucher program and a boost in funding for charter schools.

DeVos poured $1.7 million into Indiana from 2012-14, with the grant money mostly benefiting a school choice network.

The DeVos family and affiliated organizations have also contributed $2.5 million to Hoosier politicians since 2004, including $95,000 last year to Gov. Eric Holcomb, Pence’s chosen successor. Pence’s gubernatorial campaign received at least $15,000.

In announcing their opposition to DeVos, Collins and Murkowski questioned both her experience and commitment to public schools.

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., voted Tuesday to advance DeVos’ nomination to the Senate floor.

Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., has said he will oppose her confirmation.

Dec. 19 (UPI) -- One of North Korea's most powerful politicians has left his post with Pyongyang's National Sports Guidance Committee, state media reported.

Choe Ryong Hae, who may have become North Korea's second most powerful man after Kim Jong Un following the reported purge of Gen. Hwang Pyong So, has left his position as the chair of the national sports committee, Yonhap reported Tuesday.

It is unclear whether Choe Ryong Hae will be delegated other responsibilities, including those previously assigned to Hwang.

Choe Hwi, a relatively unknown politician, has replaced Choe Ryong Hae on the sports committee and will also assume the position of vice chairman of the Korean Workers' Party, Pyongyang's news agency, KCNA, reported.

Both roles until recently belonged to Choe Ryong Hae.

North Korea has yet to agree to send its athletes to compete at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, but if Kim consents, Choe Hwi, and not Choe Ryong Hae, is expected to accompany North Korean sports teams to the South.

It is unclear whether the reshuffling of politicians means North Korea is closer to a decision on the Olympics and participation in the Winter Games.

Choe Hwi's appointment came to light in a report from KCNA covering North Korea's victory at the E-1 Football Championship last week, where North Koreans scored a 2-0 win over Japan.

"Comrade Choe Hwi, the chairman of the National Sports Guidance Committee and vice chairman of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee, along with Comrade Ri Ryong Nam, and Comrade Kim Il Kuk, met the women's football team and coach at Pyongyang International Airport," KCNA stated.

Hwang's purge was first revealed by Seoul's National Intelligence Service in December, and could have been the result of a power struggle between Hwang and Choe Ryong Hae, Newsweek reported.

Choe Ryong Hae accompanied North Korean athletes to the Rio Olympics in 2016 and to the Asian Games in South Korea in 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000668-8c2253ff8019e85ca5c39a86045cd3e0.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005620 00000000000 015037  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        CLOSE Scientists at the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme and the University of Aberdeen found extremely high levels of chemical pollution in a whale corpse.

A killer whale found dead on the Scottish island of Tiree had one of the highest levels of PCB pollution ever recorded, scientists say.

Lulu, well known to researchers as one of the last surviving whales in the waters around Britain, died after becoming entangled in fishing rope in January 2016. The Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme and the University of Aberdeen conducted an in-depth investigation of Lulu's carcass and were shocked by the findings. The headline on its website called the killer whale the "most contaminated on the planet."

Veterinary pathologist Andrew Brownlow said studies have shown that killer whale populations can have very high levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB).

"The levels in this case are some of the highest we’ve ever seen," he said. "We know Lulu died from becoming entangled, but, given what is known about the toxic effects of PCBs, we have to consider (the contamination) could have been affecting her health and reproductive fitness."

Analysis of Lulu’s blubber revealed PCB concentrations 100 times higher than the accepted toxicity threshold for marine mammals, the stranding scheme reports. High PCB levels are linked to poor health, impaired immune function, increased susceptibility to cancers and infertility.

Once PCBs get into the marine environment, they accumulate through food chains and are difficult if not impossible to remove, Brownlow said.

The investigation revealed that Lulu was at least 20 years old but apparently never reproduced, despite being much older than the average age for maturity in killer whales. Brownlow called Lulu’s apparent infertility an ominous warning and said it is "increasingly likely that this small group will eventually go extinct." Lulu lived in a pod of about eight whales.

PCBs were banned in the U.S. in 1979. From the 1920s until their ban, an estimated 1.5 billion pounds of PCBs were made for things such as microscope oils, electrical insulators, capacitors, and electric appliances such as television sets or refrigerators, the U.S. National Ocean Service says. PCBs were also sprayed on dirt roads to keep the dust down. Traces of PCBs have been detected in people and animals around the world.

Lulu’s skeleton is preserved at National Museums Scotland. The stranding scheme was set up in 1992 to analyze and report data for all marine mammals, marine turtle and basking shark stranding.

But it can and does happen.

Ousted host of Q denies claims by three women of unwanted sexual violence and threatens to sue broadcaster for $55 million.

It depends to what extent that employee’s personal activities adversely affect the workplace or the employer’s public image, legal experts said. “Anyone in a position that impacts on an employer’s brand, who behaves in a way that’s inconsistent with the brand, can be dismissed without severance. Even in a unionized environment,” said Toronto lawyer Howard Levitt, of Levitt and Grossman LLP. That’s especially true when that employee is a high-profile person and the nature of their off-hour pursuits — should they become public knowledge — would damage the employer’s brand.

The issue of employers’ rights has become a hot topic since the CBC fired high-profile radio show host Jian Ghomeshi on Sunday. The public broadcaster said “information” came to its attention “recently that precludes us from continuing our relationship with Jian Ghomeshi.” Ghomeshi stated on his Facebook page that he was fired because of the risk “of my private sex life being made public as a result of a campaign of false allegations pursued by a jilted ex girlfriend and a freelance writer.”

He said it is not unusual for him to engage in “adventurous forms of sex that included role-play, dominance and submission.” However, he said it has always been consensual. A Toronto Star story on Monday said three women allege Ghomeshi was physically violent toward them without their consent, while a fourth woman, a CBC staffer, said he told her at work, “I want to hate f--- you.” None of the women have pressed charges.

Anyone who attaches her name to the sexual assault allegations against Ghomeshi will face a fearful backlash.

Ghomeshi is also suing the CBC for $55 million on the grounds of breach of confidence and defamation. In reality, any employee can be fired for any reason. Under common law, all the employer is required to provide is reasonable notice and/or severance pay. “Good people get let go all the time. An employer is free to hire and fire at their discretion,” said David Whitten of Whitten Lublin. “Nobody has a job for life.” Many employers have codes of conduct that employees are required to sign that specifies they can be fired for conduct outside the workplace that brings the company into disrepute, Whitten noted. In a unionized environment, such as the CBC, employees can usually only be fired for “just cause,” in other words failure to perform their duties, expert said. But even in a unionized workplace, an employee can get fired if they do something on their own time that brings the employer’s brand into public disrepute, legal experts say. “Where people have engaged in really egregious behaviour, arbitrators will uphold the firing,” said Tim Gleason, a partner at the Toronto law firm Dewart Gleason. “It doesn’t have to involve criminal charges. But it can’t just be something the employer doesn’t like.” Even average people can run into trouble, Levitt noted. He cited the case of Kelly vs. Linamar Corp. An employee of no public prominence downloaded child porn in the privacy of his own home and got caught. The charges were publicly reported. Linamar fired him on the grounds his activities hurt their public image. The courts upheld the dismissal. In general, what goes on in your private life is unlikely to cause a problem, provided it remains private.

“Most people need not be concerned about what they do on their private time in their bedroom,” said Nancy Shapiro, a partner in the Toronto law firm Koskie Minsky In the Internet age, where many private activities can become public, that means being careful about what you post online, and who might be recording your activities on their cellphone camera, Levitt cautioned. The onus is on the employer to prove the employee’s personal activities harmed the business, said Howard Goldblatt, a partner in the Toronto law firm Sack Goldblatt Mitchell. “I had a case where there was a domestic abuse issue to which the individual pleaded guilty. It had no impact on their employment. The arbitrator ordered them reinstated,” Goldblatt said. Such cases are often not straightforward, Goldblatt said. “People have a right to be different. The question is to what extent the employer has an interest in them not being different.”

The NYPD says the victim, who has not been identified, was found at around 10:30 p.m. in a dorm room at 80 Lafayette Street, known as Lafayette Hall. He was pronounced deceased at the scene. Police say they are investigating the death, though they do not suspect any criminality.



The Daily News reports that the victim was a student, and that he was found by his roommate. NYU has not yet responded to request for comment.

We will update when more information becomes available.

If someone you know exhibits warning signs of suicide: do not leave the person alone; remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt; and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.                                  0000538-229a9fba39958ae7d14e26329b05fcf3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010445 00000000000 015122  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        On the day it turned itself on, Mr. Melnikov recalled, his cellphone had rung in the kitchen. He talked for about 10 minutes. Then he smelled smoke. The oven was roaring. The thermometer was in flames.

“Maybe the ringing cellphone turned it on,” Mr. Melnikov suggested to the two men.

They scoffed.

He laid the phone next to the stove. They dialed it. Suddenly, the electronic control on the stovetop beeped. The digital display changed from a clock to the word “high.” As the phone was ringing, the broiler was heating up.

Three other apartments in the building are fitted with the same make and model oven: Maytag Model CGR1425ADW. “My phone turned on all of them,” Mr. Melnikov reported. “One apartment had a General Electric. It didn’t work on that one.”

On Thursday, Mr. Melnikov welcomed a skeptical visitor — me — into his kitchen.

“Will it happen now?” I asked.

“Sure,” he said.

He reconnected the oven, which he had unplugged from the wall for safety, and turned the gas valve on. I dialed his number. The electronic pad on the oven beeped, the word “high” appeared, and the phone rang. The flames were licking from the broiler jets.

“It goes right to the high setting on the broiler,” he said. “It prefers high.”

He disconnected the oven. I asked him to show me again, and he cheerfully started over. Once again, a call to his cellphone turned it on.

Maytag learned about the rogue oven from a report on WINS 1010, which broke the story last week. A company technician confirmed the problem.

“In our experience, this situation is highly unusual,” said Jill M. Saletta, a spokeswoman for Maytag. “We have offered to replace the unit with a brand-new one, at no cost, and will be taking the old unit to fully test in our lab.” Any other ovens with the same problem will also be replaced, she said.

City fire marshals came to the apartment Friday and saw a demonstration. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission has written to Mr. Melnikov for information. Ms. Saletta said all Maytag’s appliances are tested and meet safety standards set by Underwriters Laboratory and the American National Standards Institute.

The landlord of the building, Arkadiy Eydlin, said he bought the Maytag ovens about four years ago. “Maybe around $500, $400 each,” he said. “It’s not the most expensive, and it’s not the cheapest one.”

Cellphones, which send signals at up to 3 watts, often create electromagnetic interference with baby monitors, computer speakers and car radios, so it’s not surprising that they might also affect an oven’s electronic controls. People with heart pacemakers are cautioned not to carry phones in pockets over the implant. Engineers for Consumer Reports say that it is possible that Mr. Melnikov’s cellphone induced voltages in the keypad of the oven.

Whatever the exact mechanism, the evidence is strong that these Maytag models are vulnerable to cellphones — and not just the one owned by Mr. Melnikov. The superintendent was able to turn on the oven in his own apartment by calling his own cellphone, which is a Samsung. Mr. Melnikov has a Sony Ericsson PDA.

“I couldn’t afford it, but it was a gift, like four years ago,” he said. “It was maybe $700 then. More than the oven.”

Mr. Melnikov, 35, who emigrated from Russia in 2000, runs a company that sets up computers, networks and security systems. His apartment is crowded with electronics gear. The oven fire unnerved him and his wife. “Not for the material things,” he said. “I have three chinchillas.”

The next big cooking holiday in their home will be Thanksgiving. “Actually, right now, cooking turkey, it’s easier than ever,” Mr. Melnikov said. “It takes just one phone call.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000664-ad3edc78f7e96113d7f7691dbbdf3f43.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014250 00000000000 015347  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Now that Nokiasoft is (un)officially a thing, following the completion on Friday of Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar purchase of Nokia’s devices division, the question of which brand names Microsoft is going to push on its own brand smartphones comes to the fore.

Stephen Elop, formerly the Nokia chief — now freshly returned to Microsoft as head of its devices group — shed a little more light on that question today, during an Ask Me Anything on the Nokia Conversations blog (now, of course, a Microsoft property — despite still having ‘Nokia’ in its name).

Asked for clarity about whether Microsoft plans to rebrand the Nokia brand to Microsoft Mobile, despite having a 10-year license to use the name on phones, Elop said that the “Microsoft Mobile Oy” name — which cropped up in a leaked memo last week — is merely a “legal construct” created to “facilitate the merger”.

Since that explanation doesn’t exactly explain a lot, he goes on to confirm in his answer that the Microsoft Mobile name will not be used on phones.

He also suggests that Microsoft won’t necessarily be pushing the Nokia brand either for very long either. (Nokia itself, of course, does still exist — as a separate company focusing on its networking business, NSN, Here maps and some addition high tech areas — so continuing to trade off of that name, even when you’ve paid for the right to do so, likely doesn’t sit right with the marketing department.)

“[Microsoft Mobile] is not a brand that will be seen by consumers,” said Elop. “The Nokia brand is available to Microsoft to use for its mobile phones products for a period of time, but Nokia as a brand will not be used for long going forward for smartphones. Work is underway to select the go forward smartphone brand.”

Answering a related question, Elop again reiterated that work is still ongoing to determine the future phone brand that Microsoft will settle on — but he did mention the C-word: consistency.

“Now that we are One company, the marketing and product folks will lay in the plans for the shift to a consistent brand. While we are not ready to share precise details, i can assure you that it will not be the “Nokia Lumia 1020 with Windows Phone on the AT&T LTE Network” … too many words! That somehow doesn’t roll off the tongue…” he added.

So basically Microsoft’s phones are going to be badged Lumia or Surface or Xbox — or some shiny new streamlined phone brand that resonates with other existing Microsoft services.

Another questioner probed Elop on the future of the Nokia X, the Finnish company’s last great platform experiment and its first Android fork.

Questions have swirled about whether Microsoft would continue the line once it took over, but Elop didn’t deliver any new intel on Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s intentions there — reiterating what he himself said at the launch of the first Nokia X handsets back in February (basically that the Nokia X is a Trojan horse designed to thrust Microsoft services into the Android ecosystem).

“Microsoft acquired the mobile phones business, inclusive of Nokia X, to help connect the next billion people to Microsoft’s services. Nokia X uses the MSFT cloud, not Google’s. This is a great opportunity to connect new customers to Skype, outlook.com and Onedrive for the first time,” he said.

Elop did add that “tens of thousands of new subscribers on MSFT services” had been seen since the launch of the Nokia X. But that’s suitably vague to sound non-committal. Likely the Microsoft jury is still out on the Nokia Android experiment.

In a follow-up question asking whether Elop generally thinks “Nokia with Android” is a good idea, Elop stressed that the Android fork is about attacking “a specific market opportunity”.

“We are being thoughtful to do it in a way that accrues benefit to Microsoft and to Lumia,” he added.

Another question — which smells suspiciously like a plant — asked whether more colour might start bleeding into Microsoft’s other hardware design, such as the Xbox and its Surface tablets, as a result of the Nokia devices acquisition.

Elop hinted that candy coloured Surfaces and brilliantly lurid Xboxes may well be in MSFT’s future hardware playbook.

“You may have seen a video today on youtube that celebrated Nokia’s arrival within Microsoft, and the theme was “more colorful”. Here in Espoo today we are all wearing the bright colors of our devices. I’m pretty sure you will see this “colorful” personality transcend into MSFT,” he said.

Elop also fielded several critical questions during the AMA — including accusations that he “killed Nokia” by discontinuing its own mobile platforms, and that he was a Microsoft Trojan horse from the moment he stepped into the Nokia CEO shoes.

“I know that there is a lot of emotion around some of the hard decisions that we had to make. Back in late 2010 and 2011, we carefully assessed the state of the internal Nokia operating system efforts. Unfortunately, we could not see a way that Symbian could be brought to a competitive level with, for example, the iPhone that had shipped THREE years earlier! And the Meego effort was significantly delayed and did not have the promise of a broad enough portfolio soon enough. We had to make a forceful decision to give Nokia the chance to compete again,” he said defending his record and decision to shutter several of Nokia’s in-house software platforms and adopt Microsoft’s Windows Phone instead.

“As a result of the work that we have done, we have transformed Nokia into a stronger company with NSN, HERE and Advanced Technologies. At the same time, our Devices and Services business has a new opportunity within a stronger Microsoft. As for the Trojan horse thing, i have only ever worked on behalf of and for the benefit of Nokia shareholders while at Nokia. Additionally, all fundamental business and strategy decisions were made with the support and approval of the Nokia board of directors, of which I was a member,” he added.

And of course, as is the AMA tradition, Elop was asked less serious stuff — including what his favourite pizza is.

January 2015 and the FDLR are still around Posted by ethuin on January 7, 2015 · 2 Comments

Roughly a week ago a much debated disarmament deadline passed for the Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Rwanda (FDLR), the infamous rebel outfit that regroups the remnants of certain Rwandan genocide culprits that ventured into eastern Congo as ex-FAR and interahamwe two decades ago. While political rhetoric has been strong and the internet-based propaganda battle even more so, little concrete developments have followed suit on the ground.

Two earlier waves of voluntary disarmament by FDLR had raised some hope among observers in May/June 2014 – even before a joint ICGLR-SADC summit had put up the ultimatum in August the same year but ever since only one further demobilisation ceremony took place a few days before the deadline passed on January 2nd. This one and the two preceding ceremonies alike combined between 200 and 300 combatants, mostly elderly and under-aged, as well as some arms stockpiles and a higher number of civilian dependents. Given the diplomatic pressure and the fact that FDLR still numbers around approximately 2,000 combatants, there is little ground to argue for a genuine will to disarm amongst the senior FDLR leadership. Rather, the Rwandan rebels have understood to play the political chess game by appeasing other stakeholders with its piecemeal approach to surrender. Political divisions and a lack of responsibility across various actors have encouraged this cul-de-sac and a swift solution is not in sight.

Now, as per the deadline’s stipulations and the UN’s offensive mandate there is an imperative to act for the major involved parties. This is the UN itself through MONUSCO and its Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) as well as regional intergovernmental organisations ICGLR and SADC. Deliberations on DRC are scheduled in two weeks at the UN Security Council (where ICGLR chair Angola just replaced Rwanda as a non-permanent member) and in the coming days during a joint ICGLR-SADC summit in Angola. These meetings will show whether a joint line of action can be found across the international and regional actors. As of now, there are a few reasons for scepticism in this regard:

First, the FIB’s troop-contributing countries (Tanzania, South Africa, and Malawi) have not significantly altered their public statements on the FDLR issue. Tensions between Tanzania, South Africa and the Rwandan government remain frozen and none of the two countries seems to be particularly eager to embark its troops on a FDLR hunt through Kivutien highlands.

Second, MONUSCO has repeatedly underlined that offensive operations against armed groups will only be carried out in conjunction with the Congolese army FARDC, such as against M23, ADF, and recently FNL. Further anti-ADF operations are scheduled for the coming weeks as senior MONUSCO officials confirmed and the FIB headquarters has temporarily been relocated – like significant parts of FARDC’s North Kivu command before – to Beni. This and the use of FIB air assets against FNL in the Ruzizi Plain seems to severely diminish the FIB’s logistic capacity to take on yet another armed group at the same time – bear in mind the FIB has only 3,000 soldiers and a limited amount of aerial assets. The Congolese leadership in turn also perceives Beni as a more burning issue than FDLR and on top of that gets increasingly embroiled in centrifugal dynamics around President Kabila, culminating in the current political gamble around Moise Katumbi and other Katangan elites.

Third, Angola may not have an interest to become the diplomatic forerunner and invest its regional clout into resolving the FDLR situation. As long as this remains a frozen issue – and FDLR’s piecemeal tactics have been rather conducive to that – Luanda can easily live with a status quo that does not affect its security interests. The main reason to take a lead for Angola remains reputational and related to regional leadership aspirations.

Fourth, even if MONUSCO and FARDC would end up staging significant military operations – and these would be endorsed and supported by ICGLR and SADC – this is everything but an easy ride. Today’s FDLR is an organisation programmed towards its own survival. While it is likely that its leaders continue to command a weakened but still well organised fighting force, there is no indication they would make use of it to openly confront a MONUSCO-FARDC coalition. As in the past, it would resort to retreat and thereby spark renewed local security dilemmas and displacement across vast swaths of the Kivus.

Fifth, it remains unclear what the Congolese government and army want. While it is obvious that there are bigger threats to Kabila than FDLR it seems that three major punch-lines prevails across Kinshasa’s political circles: 1) we need to get rid of FDLR and deal with the problem ourselves, 2) we need to get rid of FDLR, but they remain more than everything else a Rwandan militia, so it is not DRC’s responsibility, and 3) why should we dismantle a potential ally of circumstance against looming common enemies? The third point is particularly worrying given recent developments around ex-M23 repatriation and the ‘loss’ of a significant number of combatants in this process.

Sixth, how will Rwanda react if international and Congolese promises to take action against FDLR once more prove to remain hollow? The more time passes, the more legitimacy Kigali gains to handle this security threat their own way. Obviously, in its current shape FDLR does not represent an actual conventional military threat, that is, a force capable to invade Rwanda and defeat a well-equipped Rwandan Defence Forces. However, and examples have shown, FDLR has been able to launch guerrilla-styled attacks into Rwanda as recent as during the internal implosion of M23 that left various geographical avenues from Virunga Park into Rwandan territory and FDLR’s rhetoric remains aggressive against the Rwandan government. While observers disagree over how much FDLR represents a scapegoat or an actual threat for Rwanda, both a sufficient conditions for direct or indirect action in case of continued agony on the side of other powers.

Seventh, the political process is stuck. US Special Envoy Feingold announced military operations many months ago, which in his capacity and authority is surprising since it is not ultimately him giving military orders to MONUSCO and FARDC and an arrival of US special forces appears utopian. SADC in turn remains unclear about whether it fully endorses a tougher stance against FDLR, while three of its member states compose the whole FIB. MONUSCO’s leadership is eager to launch operations but restrained by several above-mentioned dynamics. ICGLR remains politicised and with little institutional leeway to become a weightier broker. These and other elements and contradictions have also prevented the set-up of a political roadmap – the 11+4 framework accord is stalled anyway – that would be necessary to join military action in order to achieve a durable solution.

In its entirety, the complicated conundrum of these seven dynamics represent a ‘back-to-square-one’ situation, in which the passed deadline turns out be a political failure. Besides a few little changes, the situation around FDLR is basically the same it has been half a year ago and, few months before MONUSCO’s and FIB’s current mandates run out, the prospects for dismantling FDLR are as good (or bad) they have been before the deadline. We will see in the coming weeks whether there will be significant changes to that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000595-dad24f36f93b9465118972d3ec7512e4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004164 00000000000 014767  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A draft bylaw that would allow human ashes to be scattered or buried in Christchurch's parks and reserves may be changed after objections from local iwi.

The Christchurch City Council's draft 2014 Parks and Reserves Bylaw was going to include a provision for ashes to be interred if written approval was sought from the council but it is now being reconsidered because it could be culturally offensive.

Mahaanui Kurataiao Ltd (MKT), a company that acts on behalf of the six runanga within Christchurch city, has told the council that if it enables the scattering of ashes in public places, it will alienate Ngai Tahu whanau from those public parks and reserve spaces.

It has cautioned that even if the scattering of ashes occurs on a limited or restricted basis Ngai Tahu whanau will be indefinitely bound in those parks and reserves by the same kawa (protocols) that apply in designated urupa (cemetery). That means they will be unable to eat, laugh, run or play in those areas.

MKT has asked the council to amend the bylaw to prohibit the burial or scattering of ashes of any deceased person or animal in any public park or reserve.

The bylaw was to be adopted by the council last week but it has been referred back to the hearings panel that considered the public submissions so it can give further thought to the concerns raised by MKT.

Hearings panel chairman Cr David East said the disposal of human ashes was a culturally sensitive issue and the panel would need to tread carefully.

It would probably seek to meet with MKT so it could get a better understanding of their concerns before making a final recommendation on how to proceed.

The existing Parks and Reserves Bylaw, which dates back to 2008, contains no provisions relating to the scattering of ashes and they can be scattered anywhere, including rivers and parks and reserves. The only exception is for the Botanic Gardens, where the scattering of ashes is prohibited.

East said the reason why staff had included tighter controls in the draft bylaw was because some plants did not tolerate human ash so the council wanted to have more control over the areas where they could be scattered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0000645-54cd8653e587ed49aa14d58395c6c019.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003144 00000000000 014767  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Regular smoking of marijuana by itself causes visible and microscopic injury to the large airways that is consistently associated with an increased likelihood of symptoms of chronic bronchitis that subside after cessation of use. On the other hand, habitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function when assessed either cross-sectionally or longitudinally, except for possible increases in lung volumes and modest increases in airway resistance of unclear clinical significance. Therefore, no clear link to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been established. Although marijuana smoke contains a number of carcinogens and cocarcinogens, findings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk for the development of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use, although evidence is mixed concerning possible carcinogenic risks of heavy, long-term use. Although regular marijuana smoking leads to bronchial epithelial ciliary loss and impairs the microbicidal function of alveolar macrophages, evidence is inconclusive regarding possible associated risks for lower respiratory tract infection. Several case reports have implicated marijuana smoking as an etiologic factor in pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum and bullous lung disease, although evidence of a possible causal link from epidemiologic studies is lacking. In summary, the accumulated weight of evidence implies far lower risks for pulmonary complications of even regular heavy use of marijuana compared with the grave pulmonary consequences of tobacco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0000501-ec4463bbb675c55e097de22eb9dc40b7.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006520 00000000000 015237  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Premier allocates $310 million for North Parramatta revamp as community questions apartment plan

Posted

A western Sydney community group has lashed back at the NSW Government's North Parramatta "vandal" apartment plans as the Premier announced $310 million to revamp the historic riverfront site.

The site contains early colonial buildings, the Parramatta Gaol, the Female Factory and an orphan school.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian made the funding announcement on Sunday morning saying it would rejuvenate the 30-hectare site with much of it closed to public access because it had fallen into disrepair.

Recently, archaeologists uncovered artefacts from the area that showed evidence of coexistence between Aboriginal people and European settlers.

"There's also been enormous archaeological finds on this site, too many buildings are wasting away but we are rehabilitating them for public use at the moment the public are discouraged from coming here because it's dangerous, it's not accessible. That will change," the Premier said.

'Gift to future generations'

The Government has allocated $310 million dollars to revamp the North Parramatta precinct's historical buildings over seven to 10 years, open up Parramatta River foreshore and build community parks and gardens.

"Parramatta has such a proud history of colonial and Indigenous history and it's wonderful that history is being rejuvenated," Ms Berejiklian said.

NSW Planning Minister Anthony Roberts described the funding as a "gift to future generations" of Parramatta residents and local MP, Geoff Lee, also backed up the Premier's funding announcement.

"We are going to create the largest heritage precinct in Australia — allowing us to restore, adapt and reuse and open up this whole precinct so Parramatta will be know for its long standing heritage — telling the story of how the nation started," he said.

A significant portion of the funds would go into relocating Cumberland Hospital East Campus, according to agency responsible for delivering the project — UrbanGrowth NSW.

One third of the site will be allocated for public use and community consultation will continue.

'Parramatta's soul' at risk

The North Parramatta residents action group is not sold on the Government's plan to allow construction of 2,700 apartments at the site as part of their urban transformation and say they have been light on details about the residential development.

"For the past two years they've only been focusing on the heritage core and won't discuss the objections with the community to the … residential units that they want to build and ruin this site with," group president Suzette Meade said.

Ms Meade said that the site has UNESCO World Heritage List potential and the apartments would get in the way of this important classification.

"I think if this turns into a residential development as the State Government wants proposes to do, it will totally vandalise the story of this site and any opportunity for it to be World Heritage listed," she said.

"This is Parramatta's soul. This is where the colony started. This is where 5,000 convict women came to Australia and this was their home.

"One in seven Australians can link back to these women, the mothers of our colony right here.

"It must be heritage listed."

The falling value of the rouble and lower oil prices have hit profits at oil giant BP.

The company made $3bn (£1.86bn) in the July-to-September period, down from $3.7bn for the period last year.

BP, a big investor in Russia through its 20% stake in Rosneft, said the depreciation of the rouble against the dollar dragged down profits.

Net income from Rosneft fell to $110m, from $808m in the same quarter last year.

Lower Urals oil prices also hurt profits, BP said in a statement.

Also on Tuesday, Rosneft unexpectedly delayed publication of its own third-quarter profit figures. The company, which is feeling the impact of Western sanctions over Ukraine, did not give a reason.

The rouble has fallen to all-time lows against the dollar, the currency used to price oil.

'On track'

During the quarter, BP paid out another $314m related to the fatal Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and subsequent massive oil spillage in the Gulf of Mexico.

The payment brings to $20bn the cumulative charges for the disaster.

Despite the fall in profits, chief executive Bob Dudley was upbeat about the performance.

"Growing underlying production of oil and gas and a good downstream [refining oil] performance generated strong cash flow in the third quarter, despite lower oil prices. This keeps us well on track to hit our targets for 2014," he said.

That optimism was backed by analyst Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers. "Despite being attacked on many fronts, BP is steadfastly continuing on its road to recovery," he said.

He highlighted BP's strong cash flow and reduction in capital expenditure.

BP's share price, which has fallen about 14% in the last three months, gained 0.4% in early trading in London.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000653-f064e5d846f987e04cc47ad0e3a9c284.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000017730 00000000000 015130  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Anaheim Ducks general manager Bob Murray saw almost all positives in a 2012-13 season when his team flew out of the gate and never really slowed down, ultimately winning the franchise's first Pacific Division title in five years and earning the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference.

Even a loss in Game 7 of the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs to the Detroit Red Wings, though disappointing, didn't change Murray's opinion.

"I think we got beat by a team that had been injured all year long but was getting healthy and was a very veteran, experienced playoff team," he told NHL.com. "I looked at it as some of our younger players -- while it would have been nice to have another round -- got some really quality playoff time, and our younger players played very, very well for us. That’s a giant plus for us, that they got there and they got to experience playing a great team like the Detroit Red Wings.

"I don't look at any negatives from that -- except we lost."

Losing is something the Ducks didn't do too much of last season. They won seven of their first eight games and 13 of their first 16 en route to finishing second in the conference with 66 points, behind the Chicago Blackhawks (77).

That's a big change from the previous season, when the Ducks started 6-13-4 and finished 13th in the West.

"When you're a mid-salary cap team, which we are, you cannot afford to have injuries, bad streaks," Murray said. "Two years ago, we had some very bad injuries and just never recovered from the bad start."

It didn't help that all-star center Ryan Getzlaf had the worst season of his career, finishing with 11 goals, 57 points and a minus-11 rating. Murray said he believes Getzlaf also struggled adjusting to his role as captain in the 2011-12 season.

"It was an off year for a lot of people in our organization and Ryan Getzlaf took most of the heat for that," Murray said. "But I can go down the list and there were a lot of guys that had bad years, and we had injuries. It was a bad year for the organization. When you're a mid-cap team, you can't afford certain things to happen. One of them is injuries, and the other was [Getzlaf] had a rough year offensively. He also, being the captain, I think sometimes he overthinks it a little bit."

Getzlaf was back to his usual star form last season, finishing with a team-best 49 points in 44 games. There also was improvement off the ice.

"Last year he didn't overthink at all," Murray said. "He's growing with being captain. He's very serious about it. Sometimes you can just play, and last year he just played."

The solid play of Getzlaf raised the team around him. The Ducks upped their scoring average from 2.45 goals per game to 2.79, and the power play rose from No. 21 in the League at 16.6 percent in 2011-12 to fourth in the League at 21.5 percent.

Some of that was a byproduct of the team adjusting to coach Bruce Boudreau's up-tempo offensive style. Boudreau replaced Randy Carlyle in November 2011, but only this fall will he have his first training camp.

"The biggest thing for Bruce is now he knows everybody in our system," Murray said. "It's tough coming in in the middle of the year a year-and-a-half ago and not knowing everybody, and then you have the lockout year the next year," Murray said. "He spent time in the minors, seeing the kids. He knows everybody now. That is his biggest advantage going forward: He knows everybody now. Coaches love to know their players."

And the Ducks' young players should give Boudreau a lot to love.

Kyle Palmieri, 22, saw time on the top line alongside Corey Perry and Getzlaf in the playoff loss to the Red Wings. Palmieri had 10 goals and 21 points in 42 regular-season games, and five points in seven playoff games. Emerson Etem, 21, made his NHL debut with three goals and seven assists in 38 games last season, and had five points in seven postseason games. Jakob Silfverberg, who arrived from the Ottawa Senators as part of the Bobby Ryan trade this summer, had 10 goals in 48 games as a rookie. Peter Holland, 22, and Rickard Rakell, 20, also are expected to compete for spots as forwards.

"It's going to be a hell of a dogfight in our training camp to see who comes out playing," Murray said.

Replacing Ryan on the top line is the first step in that competition. One of the young players could slide into that spot, or it could be someone from the team's past: Dustin Penner, who returned in July as a free agent. Penner teamed with Perry and Getzlaf to form arguably the Ducks' best line in the 2007 run to the Stanley Cup. Murray, who was the senior vice president of hockey operations on that title team, certainly remembers how well that trio performed.

"They enjoyed playing together," Murray said. "You don't know if the chemistry will still be there or not. There's been lots of guys moving in and out of that spot over the years. Dustin has done just as well as anyone else has there, probably better, because that line was very good in the Stanley Cup Playoffs that year. That's definitely in Bruce's and my mind. But again, we have lots of opportunities now for young players."

Teemu Selanne decided Aug. 30 he would return for one more season, filling the spot Murray left open for the 43-year-old.

"I want Teemu to play if he's 100 percent sure he wants to play," Murray had said. "If he's not sure, if he's not feeling ... when you get to that age, he's got to want it bad. If he's sure he wants it bad, then we'll make it work, whatever I have to do. The only answer I need is he's 100 percent sure he wants to play. That's the only answer I need. I told him that the other day. I don't care when he tells me. We'll find a way. We've got lots of cap space, we have enough contracts."

The Ducks appear set in goal with Jonas Hiller and Viktor Fasth. Fasth, who signed with the team in September 2012, emerged as a life preserver early in the season, winning his first eight starts. The 30-year-old finished his first NHL season 15-6-2 with a 2.18 goals-against average, .921 save percentage and four shutouts in 25 games.

Hiller rediscovered his form as the season progressed and eventually retook the No. 1 job. He went 15-6-4 with a 2.36 GAA and .913 save percentage in 26 games. He also started all seven playoff games, posting a 2.46 GAA.

The rotation likely will remain the same this season. And if one falters or gets injured, top prospect John Gibson -- the only non-NHL goalie invited to USA Hockey's Olympic orientation camp -- waits in the wings.

"I love the way our goaltending was last year," Murray said. "They picked each other up. When one would be banged up, the other guy would carry the ball for a while, then the other guy would get banged up and the other would carry the ball for a while. They get along very well. They're similar-type guys. I think we have good goaltending and we have good, young goaltending coming. I like where we are with goaltending."

Defensively, the Ducks have a solid mix of veterans Francois Beauchemin and Sheldon Souray and emerging young players Cam Fowler and Luca Sbisa.

It's that wealth of young players that most intrigues Murray and gives him high hopes for the present and the future.

"We had to go through the pain of retooling after the Stanley Cup year and the year after and trying to win again," Murray said. "We got ourselves in a position where we had to go back and rebuild the stock, our assets. We have good young players now. When you have that talent competing for spots as young players, I think that bodes well for the future of the franchise."

What is your assessment of contemporary Western Europe, and in particular the EU?

All major political parties in Western Europe, regardless of their different names and party programs, are nowadays committed to the same fundamental idea of democratic socialism. They use democratic elections to legitimize the taxing of productive people for the benefit of unproductive people. They tax people, who have earned their income and accumulated their wealth by producing goods or services purchased voluntarily by consumers (and of course especially the “rich” among those), and they then re-distribute the confiscated loot to themselves, i.e., the democratic State that they control or hope to control, and their various political friends, supporters, and potential voters.

They do not call this policy by its right name: punishing the productive and rewarding the unproductive, of course. That doesn’t sound particularly attractive. Instead, they tap into the always popular sentiment of envy and claim to tax the few “rich” to support the many “poor.” In truth, however, with their policy they make more and more productive people poor and a steadily increasing number of unproductive people rich.

But what about the EU?

Looking at the EU, the picture becomes even worse. The EU is the first step on the way toward the creation of a European Super-State, and ultimately of a one-world government, dominated by the USA and its central bank, the FED. From its very beginnings, and despite all high-sounding political proclamations to the contrary, the EU was never about free trade and free competition. For that, you don’t need tens of thousands of pages of rules and regulations! Rather, the central purpose of the EU, supported all-along by the USA, was always the weakening in particular of Germany as Europe’s economic powerhouse. To facilitate this, Germany was sent on a seemingly never-ending “guilt trip” and thus pressured to transfer increasingly larger parts of its already limited (vis-à-vis the USA) sovereignty to the EU in Brussels. Especially noteworthy in this regard: Germany’s giving up its monetary sovereignty and abandoning its traditionally “strong” currency, the DM, in favor of a “weak” Euro, issued by a European Central Bank (ECB) composed overwhelmingly of politically connected central bankers from traditionally “weak” currency countries.

The EU, then, is characterized by three main features:

First: The harmonization of the tax and regulation structure across all member states, so as to reduce economic competition and especially tax-competition between different countries and make all countries equally uncompetitive.

Second: On top of the economic and moral perversity within each country of punishing the productive and subsidizing the unproductive, another layer of international income- and wealth-redistribution is added: of punishing economically better performing countries like Germany and the countries of northern Europe and rewarding economically worse performing countries (mostly of southern Europe) and thus successively rendering the economic performance of all countries equally worse.

And third, of increasing importance especially during the last decade: In order to overcome the rising resistance, in many countries, against the steadily increasing transfer of national sovereignty to Brussels, the EU is on a crusade to erode, and ultimately destroy, all national identities and all social and cultural cohesion. The idea of a nation and of different national and regional identities is ridiculed, and multiculturalism is hailed instead as an unquestionable “good.” As well, in promoting the award of legal privileges and of “special protection” to everyone, except white, heterosexual men, and especially married family men (who are portrayed as historic “oppressors” owing compensation to everyone else as their historic “victims”) — euphemistically called “anti-discrimination” or “affirmative action” policy — the natural social order is systematically undermined. Normality is punished, and abnormity and deviance is rewarded.

Can one say, then, that the politicians running the EU are even worse than the politicians running national affairs?

No, and yes. On the one hand, all democratic politicians, with almost no exception, are morally uninhibited demagogues. One of my German books is titled The Competition of Crooks, which captures what democracy and democratic party politics are really all about. There is in this regard little if any difference between the political elites of Berlin, Paris, Rome, etc., and those running the show in Brussels. In fact, the EU elites are typically political has-beens, with the same mentality as their domestic counterparts, on the lookout for the super-lavish salaries, benefits, and pensions doled out by the EU.

On the other hand, the EU elites are worse than their political cronies at home, of course, in that their decisions and rulings always affect a far larger number of people.

What do you predict, then, will be the future of the EU?

The EU and the ECB are a moral and economic monstrosity, in violation of natural law and the laws of economics. You cannot continuously punish productivity and success and reward idleness and failure without bringing about the disaster. The EU will slide from one economic crisis to the next and ultimately break apart. The Brexit, that we have just experienced, is only the first step in this inevitable process of devolution and political decentralization.

Is there anything that an ordinary citizen can do in this situation?

For one, instead of swallowing the high-sounding blabber of politicians about “freedom,” “prosperity,” “social justice,” etc., people must learn to recognize the EU for what it really is: a gang of power-lusty crooks empowering and enriching themselves at other, productive people’s expense. And secondly, people must develop a clear vision of the alternative to the present morass: not a European Super-State or even a federation of nation States, but the vision of a Europe made up of thousands of Liechtensteins and Swiss cantons, united through free trade, and in competition with one another in the attempt of offering the most attractive conditions for productive people to stay or move.

Can you give a comparative assessment of the USA and the situation in Europe?

The difference between the situation in the US and Western Europe is much smaller than is generally surmised on either side of the Atlantic. For one, the developments in Europe since the end of World War II have been closely watched, steered and manipulated, whether through threats or bribes, by the political elites in Washington DC. In fact, Europe has essentially become a dependency, a satellite or vassal of the US. This is indicated on the one hand by the fact that US troops are stationed all across Europe, by now all the way right up to the Russian border. And on the other hand, this is indicated by the steady pilgrimage, performed more regularly and dutifully than any Muslim’s pilgrimage to Mecca, of the European political elites and their intellectual bodyguards to Washington DC, in order to receive their masters’ blessings. Especially the German political elite, whose guilt complex has meanwhile assumed the status of some sort of mental illness, stands out in this regard by its cowardice, submissiveness, and servility.

As for US domestic affairs, both Europeans and Americans have it typically wrong. Europeans still frequently view the US as the “land of the free,” of rugged individualism, and of unhampered capitalism. Whereas Americans, insofar as they know or claim to know anything about the world outside the US at all, frequently view Europe as a place of unhinged socialism and collectivism, entirely alien to their own “American way.” In fact, there exists no principal difference between the so-called “democratic capitalism” of the US and Europe’s “democratic socialism.”

To be sure, America has always had more and more vocal proponents of free-market capitalism, it still manages to attract many of the world’s best and brightest, and indeed, the US tax-take as a percentage of GDP lags behind that of most European countries — but not by very much, and it is actually higher than in non-EU-member Switzerland, for instance. And as for US government debt as a percentage of GDP, this is actually higher than in most European countries and places the US is in the same league as an economic basket case such as Greece, for instance. True enough also: In the US you may still pretty much say whatever you want without having to fear criminal persecution, whereas taking the same liberty in most of Europe may well land you in jail. However, the disease of “political correctness,” of “non-discrimination” and “affirmative action” that is currently sweeping the Western world like an epidemic actually originated in the US, with the so-called “civil rights” legislation of the 1960s, and it is the US, where it has been carried to the greatest excesses and the height of absurdity. And so, while saying the politically “wrong” thing may not land you in jail in the US, you will have your career destroyed there just as certainly, if not more so, than in any European country.

And as for US foreign policy: All the while the political elites of the US started to “invite” the (third) world to come to the US, long before the same disastrous “multicultural” policies were also adopted in Europe, the very same elites have pursued an aggressive policy of “invade the world” and attacked, just in the most recent decades, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and spawning a wave of Islamist terrorism, mostly funded by Saudi Arabia, with whose political elites one entertains a most cordial relationship.

Finally, how do you evaluate the economic success of formerly communist countries such as China, that combine one-party dictatorships with partly free markets?

The economic success of a country depends on three interrelated factors: the security of private property and property rights, the freedom of contract and trade, and the freedom of association and disassociation — and, of course, the diligence, intelligence, and ingenuity of its people. Each and every State, insofar as it relies on taxation for its own funding, acts in violation of these requirements. But these violations can be less extensive and far-reaching, or more so, explaining the relative success of some countries and the failure of others. The internal organization of the State, whether it is a one-party dictatorship or a multi-party democracy, is essentially irrelevant in this. Indeed, as the present example of Venezuela vividly demonstrates, democracy and democratic elections can well lead to the almost complete abolition of private property rights and the freedom of contract and trade, and result in spectacular economic collapse.

As well, the comparison of the economic performance of India vs. China is instructive in this regard. While modern India, for almost seven decades now, has been ruled by democratic governments, modern China has been ruled throughout by a communist party dictatorship, roughly half of the time, during the Mao-era, by an orthodox all-out-communist party leadership, and the second half by a regime of “liberal” reform-communists. The result? Both countries are still desperately poor as measured by Western standards, indicating that both governments showed little if any respect for private property rights. But: While the economic situation was about equally desperate in both countries until the early 1980s, since then, with the onset of the “reform communism” in China, the Chinese GDP per capita has well surpassed and risen significantly above that of India, indicating a comparatively greater scope of economic freedom in China and/or an on average brighter and more diligent Chinese population.

In conclusion, then: Don’t put your trust in democracy, but neither should you trust in a dictatorship. Rather, put your hope into radical political decentralization, not just in India and China, but everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000528-472d0a372cd8025aeb9a0eb82f307709.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002173 00000000000 015013  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        About

from the nice,-but-lots-more-needed dept

After a five-year battle by Access Info Europe, Europe's highest court has made an important ruling that will help boost transparency in the European Union: the European Court of Justice today rejected arguments by the Council of the European Union that it should be able to keep secret the identities of Member States making proposals in the context of negotiations on future EU legislation. The Council of the European Union had fought to defend its policy of releasing legislative drafting documents with the names of Member States tabling amendments blacked out. Access Info Europe won access to the document it requested before the General Court in March 2011 but the Council appealed, joined by the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Spain and the UK. The Council of the European Union is one of three bodies that jointly run the European Union, along with the European Parliament and European Commission. Some countries wanted their names blacked out from official Council of the European Union documents because it would have revealed which of them had blocked or tried to water down proposals they were hostile to. Now that it will be possible to name and shame Member States that act in this way, they will probably be less willing to be seen objecting to important and popular measures.

As Access Info Europe explains: This ruling means that members of the public at the national level will find it easier to know what is going on in Brussels, and will make it easier for national parliaments to follow and scrutinise the EU legislative process, and in particular the positions taken by delegations of Member States. Helen Darbishire, Executive Director of Access Info Europe, is quoted as saying: "We call on the Council to respect this ruling and to go a step further by henceforth proactively publishing documents containing legislative drafting positions of Member States on the Council's public register as soon as they are created, as this will allow the public to follow the decision making process." Given the Council's dogged resistance to even minimal transparency, that's unlikely to happen, but at least things have started moving in the right direction.

This is a troubling security headache because Linux is used widely across the internet, from web servers to Android smartphones, tablets and smart TVs.

The TCP/IP networking blunder, present in the open-source kernel since version 3.6, can be exploited by miscreants to confirm whether any two systems are talking to each other over a network. Furthermore, it can be abused to break their connections or insert malicious code and data into their communications if the exchange is not properly encrypted. In other words, you can hijack HTTP with this.

Crucially, you do not need to be a man-in-the-middle attacker to pull this off; you do not need to be eavesdropping on a network. You can be off to the side, firing the right packets at both ends to compromise their exchanges. You have to know the IP addresses of both sides of the connection, and you have to be able to send spoofed packets to them. And that's about it.

The security weakness was discovered by eggheads at the University of California, Riverside. It's buried within the Linux implementation of RFC 5961, which was published in 2010 and has been supported in the kernel since 2012. This standard was supposed to make internet communications more secure – but quite the opposite has happened.

"The unique aspect of the attack we demonstrated is the very low requirement to be able to carry it out," said project leader Zhiyun Qian.

"Essentially, it can be done easily by anyone in the world where an attack machine is in a network that allows IP spoofing. The only piece of information that is needed is the pair of IP addresses (for victim client and server), which is fairly easy to obtain."

RFC 5961 was designed to block spoofed packet injection attacks by introducing challenge ACK packets. To successfully insert data into a connection you have to know the two IP addresses and the source and destination ports – known as a four-tuple – plus the next valid serial numbers stamped on the exchanged packets. Challenge ACKs are used to ensure that no one is trying to forcibly introduce themselves into a valid connection.

Crucially, Linux rate limits the output of these challenge ACKs.

On a simple level, here's how a hijacking could work: after inferring the source and destination ports in a connection between a server and a client, an attacker can hit the server with dodgy packets to confuse it and make it send challenge ACKs to the client until the server hits its limit and temporarily stops sending them. This gives the attacker an opportunity to determine the next correct sequence numbers so it can ultimately break or inject itself into the connection.

As a workaround while patches to fix the problem are prepared and distributed, you can raise the rate limit on your Linux machine or gadget so that it cannot be reached, by appending the following to /etc/sysctl.conf :

net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 999999999

And then use sysctl -p to activate the new rule. You need to be root to do this.

According to the researchers:

The root cause of the vulnerability is the introduction of the challenge ACK responses and the global rate limit imposed on certain TCP control packets. The feature is outlined in RFC 5961, which is implemented faithfully in Linux kernel version 3.6 from late 2012. At a very high level, the vulnerability allows an attacker to create contention on a shared resource, ie, the global rate limit counter on the target system by sending spoofed packets. The attacker can then subsequently observe the effect on the counter changes, measurable through probing packets. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the attack is extremely effective and reliable. Given any two arbitrary hosts, it takes only 10 seconds to successfully infer whether they are communicating. If there is a connection, subsequently, it takes also only tens of seconds to infer the TCP sequence numbers used on the connection. To demonstrate the impact, we perform case studies on a wide range of applications. The basic idea is to repeat the following steps: 1) send spoofed packets to the connection under test (with a specific four-tuple), 2) create contention on the global challenge ACK rate limit, ie, by creating a regular connection from the attacker to the server and intentionally triggering the maximum allowed challenge ACKs per second, and 3) count the actual number of challenge ACKs received on that connection. If this number is less than the system limit, some challenge ACKs must have been sent over the connection under test, as responses to the spoofed packets.

For encrypted HTTPS or SSH transmissions the worst that can be done is to break the connection. But with unencrypted traffic, the attacker could insert new content into communications and even add malware, with no additional input from the two legitimate owners of the connection.

The boffins, presenting at the 25th Usenix Security Symposium in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, demonstrated the hack on the main website of USA Today, by injecting JavaScript code that siphoned off passwords from a reader login form. Sites like this are perfect because they have long duration connections between content on the site and servers providing it.

They also demonstrated an attack against a Tor relay server – set up specially so as not to interfere with legitimate traffic – and examined 40 Tor relays around the world. Sixteen relays rejected the attack, probably due to firewalls blocking the packets, but the team broke 88.8 per cent of the rest in an average time of 51.1 seconds.

"In general, we believe that a DoS attack against Tor connections can have a devastating impact on both the availability of the service as a whole and the privacy guarantees that it can provide," the team said in a white paper [PDF].

"The default policy in Tor is that if a connection is down between two relay nodes, say a middle relay and an exit relay, the middle relay will pick a different exit relay to establish the next connection. If an attacker can dictate which connections are down (via reset attacks), then the attacker can potentially force the use of certain exit relays."

The team notes that while later versions of Linux are vulnerable to this attack, Windows, OS X and FreeBSD aren't vulnerable because they haven't fully implemented RFC 5961 as yet. The flaw finders have developed and distributed a patch for this serious error, but that's still going to leave a lot of servers unpatched – and the exploit only requires one end of the communicators to be unpatched for the hack to work. ®                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0000726-ec67f162f21af4ff2909f22ae5f26165.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004600 00000000000 015110  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In late January, a few blogs associated with Saban Brands’ Ambassador program posted up articles stating that Digimon Fusion, the company’s adaptation of Digimon Xros Wars, would be airing on YTV starting February 28th. I teased that tidbit in I Miss Bionix’s coverage of that recent Pokémon invasion. Ultimately Zap2it, and YTV’s schedule didn’t agree with that premiere date, so I figured things were pushed back. Apparently it was just a single week as it looks like the show premiered on March 7th. Episode 3 premieres this Friday at 7:30AM EDT.

Saban Brands describes this latest incarnation of the Digimon franchise as:

Digimon Fusion is the all-new animated series and sixth installment of the Digimon franchise. The action packed series follows Mikey, a human boy, who is transported into the digital world and must team up with his new “Digimon” or “Digital Monster” friends to defeat evil once and for all. New fusion powers allow Digimon to combine and fuse, creating endless battle possibilities.

Digimon Fusion marks the return of the property to YTV. The channel had previously aired the first four seasons of the show, with the fifth, Digimon Data Squad, receiving a run on Family Channel.

Digimon Fusion premiered last fall on Nickelodoen in the US, before quickly being scooted off to the network’s Nicktoons sister channel. A secondary broadcast began on January 25th during Saban Brands’ Vortexx block on The CW. The 79 episode series originally ran from 2010 to 2012 in Japan.

This is one of the few times in this blog’s history that I’m late in reporting something and it’s not due to my sheer laziness or general apathy towards the subject matter. Digimon Fusion never received a proper announcement for a broadcast on YTV. It wasn’t mentioned in their March press release, nor their social media feeds. Heck, outside of that slightly vague Tweet I posted earlier, the show’s March broadcast was never acknowledged by Saban. I only learned about the broadcast through a Twitter user bringing it to my attention.

In some other house keeping, Power Rangers Super Megaforce (what a creative title) has been airing on the channel since March 1st in the 12:30PM slot. It’s kind of weird that Digimon isn’t joining Power Rangers in the Saturday afternoon slots, especially considering the fact that B-Daman Crossfire is now out of season.

From the Telegraph:

Militant Islamist rebels in Syria linked to al-Qaeda have asked for “understanding and forgiveness” for cutting off and putting on display the wrong man’s head. In a public appearance filmed and posted online, members of Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham [ISIS], one brandishing a knife, held up a bearded head before a crowd in Aleppo. They triumphantly described the execution of what they said was a member of an Iraqi Shia militia fighting for President Bashar al-Assad.

An ISIS spokesman admitted he was Mohammed Fares, an Ahrar commander reported missing some days ago.

It wasn’t, the beheaders soon discovered to their not inconsiderable chagrin.

Ahrar refers to Ahrar al-Sham, a violent Sunni Islamist band of rebels aligned with ISIS.

The men responsible for the misdirected noggin-chopping will not have to fear for their souls:

[ISIS spokesman Omar] al-Qahtani made reference to a story in which Mohammed said Allah would forgive a man who killed a believer in error.

Indiscriminate cruelty and slaughter has long been a way of life for these types. I guess I’m supposed to be sad when it becomes a way of death for them too, but for once I’ll nod along in agreement with Jesus, who is said to have stated the inevitability of violence begetting violence pretty succinctly: “He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.”

Mohammed Fares was another Islamist boil on the ass of humanity. It’s an unpleasant procedure, but boils need to be lanced. Or beheaded — same thing.

Read: Are Your Porn Habits Racist?

The people of North Carolina have already lost a Springsteen concert over their state's recent anti-LGBT "bathroom" law, and now they're losing their pornography, too. According to Huffington Post, the porn site XHamster has begun blocking IPs in North Carolina from accessing their site and a veritable cornucopia of jerkoff material.

Now when computer users across the state try to head over to the porn site, they'll be met with a black screen instead of the dicks and boobs they wanted. XHamster also plans to replace the black screen soon with a petition to repeal the discriminatory law.

"We have spent the last 50 years fighting for equality for everyone and these laws are discriminatory which XHamster.com does not tolerate," XHamster's spokesman told the Huffington Post in a statement. "We will not standby and pump revenue into a system that promotes this type of garbage. We respect all sexualities and embrace them.

"I think that porn has the power to do what Bruce Springsteen can't," the statement continued.

HuffPo adds that XHamster also promotes the less-than-progressive Donald Trump in an advertisement on its site. What a world!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0000618-b7655dc7282bb7f87511f4d7148e04e1.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011241 00000000000 014753  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Trump administration on Tuesday issued new guidelines that constitute a "sweeping rewrite" of Obama-era policies on immigration, greatly expanding the number of individuals that can be forcibly deported and further emboldening the current crackdown.

The memoranda on implementation (pdf) and enforcement (pdf) of President Donald Trump's recent executive orders on immigration, which were dated Monday and published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), were leaked to news agencies over the holiday weekend and sparked wide concern among immigrants and civil liberties organizations.

The official guidelines, signed by DHS Secretary John Kelly, "expand raids and the definition of criminal aliens, while diminishing sanctuary areas and enlisting local law enforcement to execute federal immigration policy," The Hill reported.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday press call, Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said the memos are "breathtaking in scope," adding that "they basically throw the rule of law out the window."

In short, as the Guardian observed, they "represent a sweeping rewrite of the nation's immigration enforcement priorities."

In fact, the only Obama administration immigration guidelines kept in place are those relating to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, also known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

"These memos confirm that the Trump administration is willing to trample on due process, human decency, the well-being of our communities, and even protections for vulnerable children, in pursuit of a hyper-aggressive mass deportation policy."

—Omar Jadwat, ACLU

Whereas President Barack Obama prioritized undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes for removal, the new memo states that DHS "no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement," thus expanding the scope to include any undocumented individual charged with—or even suspected of—a crime, including minor traffic offenses.

However, as Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur pointed out, Obama limited deportation to serious offenders for largely bureaucratic reasons:

Reason Obama exempted certain ppl is every DHS resource used to deport a non-dangerous person = one less available to find/remove criminals. — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) February 21, 2017

Further, in one of the more controversial stipulations, the memos state that parents who help children enter the U.S. illegally could be subject to deportation or criminal prosecution.

"Regardless of the desires for family reunification, or conditions in other countries, the smuggling or trafficking of alien children is intolerable," one memo reads.

Summarizing the order, the New York Times noted that the policy "also calls for an expansion of expedited removals, allowing Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to deport more people immediately. Under the Obama administration, expedited removal was used only within 100 miles of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include those who have been in the country for up to two years, and located anywhere in the nation."

The documents also direct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hire up to 10,000 new agents, expand the number of detention facilities, and detain individuals at the start of removal proceedings, rather than giving a notice to appear in court.

The new regulations, The Hill pointed out, "also restore programs for local law enforcement collaboration with federal authorities that were tabled under the Obama administration because of concerns that they violated due process or were a hindrance to local authorities."

"These memos confirm that the Trump administration is willing to trample on due process, human decency, the well-being of our communities, and even protections for vulnerable children, in pursuit of a hyper-aggressive mass deportation policy," said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.

"However," Jadwat added, "President Trump does not have the last word here—the courts and the public will not allow this un-American dream to become reality."

The new rules come amid a widespread immigration crackdown, with deportation raids already targeting law-abiding and long-term residents. According to reporting, DHS' Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are expected to hold talks in Mexico beginning Wednesday with border security and trade at the top of the agenda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0000651-db3f3c0108aebc14729a16b0c7ee036d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002653 00000000000 015217  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Former President Bill Clinton said Friday that he regretted drowning out the chants of black protesters at a rally in Philadelphia the day before, when he issued an aggressive defense of his administration’s impact on black families. His reaction thrust a debate about the 1990s into the center of his wife’s presidential campaign, one that has focused heavily on issues of race and criminal justice.

“I know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television,” Mr. Clinton said Friday of the Black Lives Matter protesters who had accused him and Hillary Clinton of supporting policies that devastated black communities. “But that doesn’t mean that I was most effective in answering it.”

His statement did not quiet a raging storm of criticism. Still, it was a remarkable reversal for Mr. Clinton, who occupies a singular role in his wife’s campaign as a spouse and a popular former president who can sometimes make himself into a lightning rod. He has had to campaign for his wife in an era when signature policies of his administration have been repudiated both by Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

None of those issues has been more central to the 2016 campaign than the 1994 crime bill, which created tougher penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, erected dozens of new prisons, banned certain types of assault weapons and sent 100,000 more police officers to American cities.                                                                                     0000710-3bfdf95f92ba392de1ff4447d744a6e8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003435 00000000000 015264  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        United States Navy personnel distributing Pedialyte to victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh

Pedialyte is an oral electrolyte solution manufactured by Abbott Laboratories and marketed for use in children. It was invented by Dr. Gary Cohen of Swampscott, Massachusetts.

Description [ edit ]

Pedialyte is designed to promote rehydration and electrolyte replacement in ill children. It "meets the requirements of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Nutrition to help prevent dehydration in infants and children."[1]

Pedialyte is lower in sugars than most sports drinks, containing 100 calories per liter compared to approximately 240 in Gatorade. It contains more sodium (1,035 milligrams per liter vs. 465 mg/L in Gatorade) and potassium (780 milligrams per liter vs. 127 mg/L in Gatorade). Pedialyte does not contain sucrose, because this sugar has the potential to make diarrhea worse by drawing water into the intestine, increasing the risk of dehydration. In its flavored formulations, Pedialyte uses the synthetic sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame potassium.[2]

Pedialyte has become a hydration alternative to sports drinks for some athletes. [3]

Pedialyte has become a popular drink for people suffering from hangovers, with one third of its sales coming from adults. There has been a 57% increase in its use by adults since 2012. As a result, Pedialyte has begun a marketing campaign promoting the use of Pedialyte by hungover adults.[4][5]

Pedialyte is similar to rehydration fluids used by the World Health Organization (WHO) such as "New Oral Rehydration Solution" (N-ORS), that are used during the outbreak of illnesses such as cholera and rotavirus. Similar products include Lytren, NormaLyte, Gastrolyte, Ricelyte, Resol, and Drip Drop.[6]

For years, researchers have been aware of numerous security flaws in electronic voting machines. They've found ways to hack the machines to swap votes between candidates, reject ballots or accept 50,000 votes from a precinct with just 100 voters.

Yet on Nov. 6, millions of voters -- including many in hotly contested swing states -- will cast ballots on e-voting machines that researchers have found are vulnerable to hackers. What is more troubling, say some critics, is that election officials have no way to verify that votes are counted accurately because some states do not use e-voting machines that produce paper ballots.

After the "hanging chad" controversy of the 2000 election, Congress passed a federal law that gave states funding to replace their punch card and lever voting systems with electronic voting machines. But computer scientists have repeatedly demonstrated that a variety of electronic voting machines can be hacked -- often quite easily.

"Every time they are studied, we find further problems," said J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan who researches voting machine security.

"It's simply a matter of reprogramming these machines to be dishonest," Halderman added. "That's what we found six years ago and it's still true today, and many of these machines are still in use."

In 2008, researchers at Princeton University found that it took seven minutes, using simple tools, to install a different computer program in a voting machine "that steals votes from one party's candidates, and gives them to another." That machine, the Sequoia Avantage, is still used in at least six states by 9 million voters, according to Roger Johnston, who heads the vulnerability assessment team at Argonne National Laboratory.

Last fall, Johnston and his team of researchers found that Diebold's AccuVote voting machines could be hacked to change voting results by inserting a piece of electronics into the machines. Diebold's AccuVote voting machines are used in at least 20 states by 21 million voters, according to Johnston.

"I've seen high school science fair projects that are more sophisticated than what is needed to hijack a voting machine," Johnston said in an interview.

Most voting machines are made by two manufacturers, Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, which was formerly Diebold Election Systems. Neither company returned requests for comment.

Researchers say it's difficult to determine whether voting machine manufacturers have fixed cyber-security flaws because the companies do not share their software code publicly. In addition, there is little pressure on them from elections officials to do so, Johnston said.

"The voting manufacturers are in denial," Johnston said. "They are not doing anything about these problems, but their customers are not asking them to, either."

However, there is no evidence that hackers have ever manipulated votes in a U.S. election, experts say. And many election officials insist security concerns about voting machines are overblown. They say that security on Election Day is much stricter than, say, what a team of computer scientists with unlimited time in a laboratory might face to hack a voting machine.

"It's important to keep in mind that having full and open access to these systems is quite different than how these systems are available to voters on Election Day," said Jessica Myers, a voting systems certification specialist at U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which certifies e-voting machines.

Butler County, Ohio -- in a key swing state with more than 240,000 registered voters -- has been using AccuVote machines since 2005, according to Lynn Kinkaid, director of the county board of elections. One reason they still use the machines is that "elderly people like them because you can enlarge the print," he said.

Kinkaid said the county's e-voting machines are tested before each election, encrypted and not connected to the Internet.

"We are very sure our machines are safe and secure," he said.

Lehigh County, Pa., which has about 236,000 registered voters in another swing state, has been using Accuvote voting machines since 2006, according to Tim Benyo, the county's chief clerk for registration and elections.

Benyo said the county's e-voting machines are certified by the state, and prior to Election Day, they are locked, sealed and never left alone. He said there have been "slight modifications" to the machines' software over the years, "but nothing drastic."

"I am familiar with some reports of them being able to be hacked," Benyo said. "But my concerns are limited because these machines are not left alone with anybody for a long enough period of time."

However, Halderman, of the University of Michigan, was part of a team of researchers in 2006 that found a hacker with access to an AccuVote voting machine for just one minute could install malicious code on the machine to steal votes.

Lehigh County's e-voting machines do not produce a paper record for voters because it is not required by the state, Benyo said. One-quarter of registered voters nationwide will cast ballots on Nov. 6 using electronic voting machines that do not produce paper ballots, according to VerifiedVoting.org, a nonprofit whose mission is to safeguard elections in the digital age.

Without paper ballots -- which are counted using optical scan systems -- elections officials have no way to go back and conduct an audit to see whether votes were counted correctly, security researchers say.

"You really can't tell whether vote totals are accurate unless you have a paper ballot," said David Dill, founder of VerifiedVoting.org.



In 2006, Maryland lawmakers passed a bill that called for state election officials to stop using Diebold's AccuVote-TSx touchscreen systems, which the state has used since 2002, because the machines contained security flaws and did not produce a paper record, according to Computer World magazine.

But after the law passed, Gov. Martin O'Malley chose not to fund the purchase of new e-voting machines that produce paper ballots, according to Donna Duncan, a spokeswoman for the Maryland State Board of Elections. On Nov. 6, polling places across Maryland will still use AccuVote touchscreen machines that don't produce paper ballots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0000699-b55069559cbda6be22c609315ffdc772.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010175 00000000000 015125  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        When US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel unsealed a hoard of highly unflattering documents this week about Trump University, Donald Trump responded the way one would expect: with bullying and race-baiting.

“They ought to look into Judge Curiel,” Trump declared, “because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace.” Trump also asserted that the Indiana-born Curiel “happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great”. Trump also called for Curiel to recuse himself … on the grounds that he made decisions Trump disagreed with.

His attacks exemplify, yet again, why the prospect of a President Trump is terrifying. First of all, they suggest a rather cavalier attitude towards judicial independence. Politicians are, needless to say, free to publicly criticize judges, even when they’re one of the parties before the court. But the call to “look into” Curiel crosses a line towards being threatening.

Admittedly, there are limits to how much Trump could threaten judicial independence from the White House. Article III of the consitution provides various tools that could theoretically undermine the independence of the courts – packing federal courts with additional members selected by the president, stripping the courts of jurisdiction and removal from office. All of these actions, however, would require an act of Congress. Given that FDR’s proposal to pack the courts was rejected by Congress in the aftermath of a historic landslide in the 1936 presidential election, it’s unlikely that even a Trump-friendly Republican Congress would take such extreme measures.

But there’s still reason for concern. Would Trump be willing to abide by adverse rulings? And how much in general would Trump feel bound by legal constraints?

His threatening comments are the latest example of the authoritarian tendencies that have been central to his rise. They’re also an example of what the libertarian-leaning law professor Orin Kerr has called “the politics of delegitimization”. Because Curiel disagrees with Trump, he is therefore inherently corrupt and unfit for office. Democracy is premised, in part, on the promise that the losing factions of an election remain members of the political community. Having a president who believes that legitimate opposition is a logical impossibility is highly dangerous.

And Trump’s attacks on Curiel show that Trump’s particular “politics of delegitimization” have a strongly white supremacist component. Trump referred to Curiel as “Mexican” as a way of indicating that he was therefore not really American. This emphasis on racial hierarchy has been central to Trump’s campaign, from his proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country to his proposal to build a wall on the southern border. When Trump says he wants to “make America great again”, in large measure he means “make America more like it was when it was whiter”.

And while Republicans might like to think that the race-baiting Trump continues to engage in is incidental to his support, it’s not. As the political scientist Phil Klinkner has shown with the use of public opinion data, “Trump’s appeal has little to do with economics” but instead is primarily explained by racial resentment. Calling an American-born judge “Mexican” isn’t just a random insult; it’s part of a successful political strategy.

And it’s reminiscent of the comments that made Trump a major figure in Republican politics: his assertions that Barack Obama was not actually an American but had been born in Africa. Did Trump’s embrace of racist paranoia make him toxic within the Republican party? Hardly.

Mitt Romney might bemoan Trump now, but when he was running for president in 2012 he enthusiastically sought the endorsement of the country’s most famous birther. Trump’s disgraceful attacks on Curiel represent what he’s always been. He didn’t come out of nowhere; he’s just blunter about exploiting racial resentment than the typical national Republican politician.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0000706-56b02c84566e17fd6019ea90b27d4d52.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002423 00000000000 014743  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Police have identified a young man who allegedly deployed pepper spray into the face of an OC Transpo bus passenger in downtown Ottawa on Wednesday afternoon after an argument.

The passenger was sprayed in the face on Route 96 just after 12:30 p.m. on Slater Street near the intersection of Bank Street, police said. The spray affected other passengers but no one was transported to hospital, police said.

Police are also hoping to speak to these two witnesses of the incident. (Ottawa police)

The man, believed to be in his early 20s, left the bus with a woman, who is also believed to be in her early 20s.

The man was described as about five feet four inches tall and 160 pounds with dark blonde or brown hair and no facial hair. He was wearing a red hooded sweatshirt, grey sweatpants and a red flat beak snapback hat, police said. He was also carrying an old black and blue gym bag.

The woman with the suspect was white with reddish-brown hair in a ponytail, police said. She was wearing a black jacket and black sunglasses with a blue and yellow design on the side.

Police received tips after sharing surveillance video images of the suspect and the woman, police said Thursday.

As we enter 2015, the 20th anniversary of the first successful isolation and culture of primate pluripotent stem cells in the world, it’s time to look back and see how far we’ve come. Thanks to a young reproductive biologist who came from the University of Pennsylvania’s VMD/PhD program to the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1991, and to those whose research his groundbreaking discoveries informed, the fields of cell biology and regenerative medicine will never be the same.

Pluripotent stem cells are right now being used around the world to grow different types of cells—heart muscle cells, brain cells, pancreatic cells, liver cells, retinal cells, blood cells, bone cells, immune cells and much more.

Cultures of these cells are right now being used to test new drugs for toxicity and effectiveness.

More and more of these powerful cells are right now moving out of the lab and into preclinical (animal) trials and early human clinical trials to treat disease. The results are being published in peer-reviewed scientific journal articles on stem cell transplant, injection and infusion, reprogramming, immunology, virology and tissue engineering.

Pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives are right now being studied to learn more about reproduction and development, birth defects, and the genetic origins of disease.

Embryonic, induced pluripotent, tissue specific (adult), and other types of stem cells and genetically reprogrammed cells are all being used by researchers due to the open and collaborative environment of scientific and medical enterprises in the U.S. and around the world.

All of this is happening right now because of discoveries made 20 years ago by researchers at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center.

Here is a brief timeline of stem cell breakthroughs by WNPRC scientists:

1995- James Thomson becomes the first to successfully isolate and culture rhesus monkey embyronic stem cells (ES cells) at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center (PNAS)

becomes the first to successfully isolate and culture rhesus monkey embyronic stem cells (ES cells) at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center (PNAS) 1996-Thomson repeats this feat with common marmoset ES cells (Biol Reprod).

1998-Thomson publishes the neural differentiation of rhesus ES cells (APMIS).

1998-Thomson’s famous breakthrough growing human ES (hES) cells is published in Science. (This research occurred off campus, with private funding.)

Many subsequent stem cell “firsts” were accomplished by scientists who conducted lengthy training with James Thomson or Ted Golos, reproduction and development scientists at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center. These highlights include the following accomplishments by Primate Center researchers:

2003-WNPRC Post-doctoral trainee Thomas Zwaka achieves homologous recombination with hES cells. A method for recombining segments of DNA within stem cells, the technique makes it possible to manipulate any part of the human genome to study gene function and mimic human disease in the laboratory dish (Nature Biotechnology).

Co-authoring the work is another former Primate Center post-doc, Mark Levenstein .

These are genetically reprogrammed mature cells that act like embryonic stem cells, but without the need to destroy the embryo.

Researchers at all of the National Primate Research Centers continue to make advances in this remarkable field of research and medicine. A few more milestones include the following:

2007- Shoukhrat Mitalipov at the Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully converted adult rhesus monkey skin cells to embryonic stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer (Nature)

at the Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully converted adult rhesus monkey skin cells to embryonic stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer (Nature) 2012- Shoukhrat Mitalipov at the Oregon National Primate Research Center generation chimeric rhesus monkeys using embryonic cells (Cell)

Before all of this happened, we must note that non-primate mammalian embryonic stem cells were first successfully isolated and cultured in 1981, by Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman at the University of Cambridge, England. That breakthrough occurred almost 35 years ago. Jamie Thomson studied mouse embryonic stem cells in Pennsylvania before working on primate cells.

Even before that, in 1961, Ernest McCulloch and James Till at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Canada discovered the first adult stem cells, also called somatic stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells, in human bone marrow. That was 55 years ago.

So first it was human stem cells, then mouse, then monkey, then back to humans again. Science speaks back and forth. It reaches into the past, makes promises in the present, and comes to fruition in the future.

In every early talk I saw Jamie Thomson give about his seminal stem cell discoveries in the late 1990s and early 2000s – to staff, scientists, to the public, to Congress, to the news media – he would explain why he came to UW-Madison in the early 1990s to try to advance embryonic stem cell research. In large part, he said, it was because we had a National Primate Research Center here at UW-Madison, and also that we had leading experts in transplant and surgery at our medical school. After he joined the WNPRC as a staff pathologist and set up his lab, first he used rhesus and then marmoset embryos before expanding to cultures using human IVF patient-donated embryos off campus with private funding from Geron Corporation in Menlo Park, California.

In these early talks, Jamie included images (see above) showing how very differently the mouse blastocyst (a days-old embryo, before implantation stage) is structured from the nonhuman primate and human primate blastocysts concerning germ layer organization and early development (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm). He also was able to show for the first time how differently stem cells derived from these early embryos grow in culture. In contrast to the mouse ES cells, the monkey cells, especially those of the rhesus monkey, grow in culture almost identically to human cells.

At the time, Thomson predicted that more scientists would study human ES cells in their labs over monkey ES cells, if human ES cells could become more standardized and available. Yet he emphasized that the NPRCs and nonhuman primate models would continue to play a critical role in this research, especially when it would advance to the point when animal models would be needed for preclinical research before attempting to transplant cells and tissues grown from ES cells. Both predictions have come true.

Jamie closed his talks, and still does, with this quotation:

“In the long run, the greatest legacy for human ES cells may be not as a source of tissue for transplantation medicine, but as a basic research tool to understand the human body.”

This simply and elegantly reminds us how basic research works: Many medical advances another 20 years from now will have an important link to the discoveries of today, which have their underpinnings in that early research in Jamie Thomson’s lab 20 years ago. It will become easy to forget where it all started, when many diseases of today, if not completely cured, will become so preventable, treatable and manageable that those diagnosed with them will spend more time living their lives than thinking about how to survive another day.

Just as I did not have to worry about polio, and my children did not have to worry about chicken pox, my grandchildren will hopefully see a world where leukemia, blindness, diabetes and mental illness do not have the disabling effects or claim as many young lives as they do today.

We gave the writer Edith Zimmerman a monthly column because we love her. But like everyone, she could be better, so we asked her to write about doing things that improve herself. Follow her over the next year as she gets better and better until she reaches perfection in March 2016.

Have you ever seen a picture of yourself and thought, That can't possibly be me—who is that person? But it is you, and you're forced to acknowledge, maybe for the first time in a while, the way you actually look? I had a moment like that a few months ago. My pub trivia team had won the thing we'd been trying to win for years, and so we took a group photograph, and it was great, although after I saw the picture I faked some of the happiness, because I felt a little undone by realizing—somehow, suddenly, in that instant, I guess I was finally able to see—how far I'd let my actual appearance get from the way I thought of myself. I knew I had gained weight, but I naively kind of thought that maybe I just carried it well. I mean I knew that TECHNICALLY I'd gained like 30 or 40 pounds—I still don't want to get on a scale—but somehow I thought maybe it worked for me, or was the invisible kind of fat. Haha.



So I decided to try CrossFit, because it seemed frightening and intense, which is the opposite of my life. There are apparently about 11,000 CrossFit affiliate gyms around the world, up from 13 in 2005, nine years after it was "invented." A lot of people call it a cult and make fun of it. But the people photographed in the endless CrossFit trend pieces usually look pretty amazing, and I was definitely open to becoming addicted to and annoying about it, to becoming part of their cult, if for some miraculous reason it stuck and I could maybe end up like one of the women in cool sports bras and Spandex shorts whose bodies are so fit they're frightening.



But then I actually went to a CrossFit class.



The gym—or "box"—felt like an industrial-style, gladiator-type training cavern that had been tucked behind an unassuming, normal-size door on a Brooklyn side street. It was filled with black metal jungle gyms, bars and gymnastic rings, and stacks of weights—also rows of kettlebells and medicine balls, racks of jump ropes, a bay of rowing machines, and a corner piled with wooden crates—but mostly big expanses of open space padded with black mats and Astroturf.



At the beginning of the class, we went around saying our names and fitness histories and hopes. Some said that they ran or swam or played basketball. I said I didn't exercise at all, hoping it might give me an excuse for whatever came later, but then a cute couple who arrived late also said they didn't exercise. And then they were so fast and strong at seemingly everything and never out of breath. Especially when we were learning burpees, a horrible exercise in which you drop fully to the ground, then jump up—if you can—back to standing, and then clap your hands over your head as you hop up in the air. And then do it all again. Over and over and over.



After around ten of these, I realized that I had at some point begun making audible groaning noises, kind of like in tennis(!), which was exciting because I don't think I've ever groaned from exertion before. Then we finished with four minutes of plain air squats—20 seconds of going up and down like you're peeing, followed by ten seconds of rest, eight times over—which maybe doesn't sound too crazy but was almost certainly the hardest I've ever worked out in my life. I fell down immediately afterward, on the first steps I tried to descend, walking off the mat to the locker area.



But I was so tired I didn't care whether I looked stupid, and at that point all I wanted was to go home and lie down. And never come back.



Concern over people doing CrossFit too intensely, or with improper form, has led to at least one lawsuit, in 2008, in which the plaintiff, a Navy technician, sued his gym (not CrossFit itself), claiming that his trainers' instructions gave him rhabdomyolysis, "a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle tissue breaks down rapidly" and that is often caused by "extreme physical exercise." (Quotes from Wikipedia.) He had been peeing blood and was hospitalized for a month, and he eventually won $300,000. To raise awareness about improper technique, CrossFit CEO Greg Glassman has run several articles on rhabdomyolysis in CrossFit's (non-peer-reviewed) online publication, CrossFit Journal. In one 2005 post (three years before the lawsuit), Glassman wrote:

To date we have seen five cases of exertional rhabdo associated with CrossFit workouts. Each case resulted in the hospitalization of the afflicted... The hardest hit was extremely sick, the least afflicted had no complaints other than soreness... Soreness doesn't adequately explain the discomfort of rhabdo, however. The worst hit, a SWAT guy, recounts that six days of intravenous morphine drip barely touched the pain.

The illustration accompanying the post, under the word "RHABDO," was a drawing of a jacked but bleeding and miserable-looking Krusty-esque clown, hooked up to a dialysis machine, his kidneys on the floor. The clown cartoon eventually came to be known as "Uncle Rhabdo," and one writer later called him, in a popular 2013 Medium post, "CrossFit's unofficial and disturbing mascot."



At home, the pain made me unexpectedly giddy and euphoric. Even though I wasn't experiencing rhabdo, LOL, I kind of loved the ache and burn—I could barely sit down normally, and if moving quickly or going up and down the stairs had been part of my job description, I might have had to take the week off. It was like there was a whole other body inside my regular one, waking up. And she was angry and mean, not because I was bothering her but because it had taken me so long to remember she was there. And I loved hobbling around and screaming when I sat down, "IN CASE ANYONE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT I WAS DOING CROSSFIT DID I MENTION CROSSFIT."



So I signed up for what's called the "On Ramp" session, a two-week, six-class beginner course in which you learn how to do all the actual CrossFit exercises appropriately, and which is required for anyone who wants to continue doing it.



The session I chose began the morning after the first class. It turned out that the gym was a lot quieter at 6 AM and only four of us had signed up. And our coach was really nice and seemed gentle and sympathetic to how intimidating it was to be there. He also seemed great about understanding everyone's personal limit and at helping without making anyone feel stupid or disgusting. He was also very fit, in a weight-lifting way, and he had a big beard.



So we all chatted a bit and then started learning some CrossFit, and for the next hour, I panted and sweated and felt weird, doing push-ups and sit-ups and pseudo-pull-ups (with a big rubber band), and I kind of had fun, or not fun, but something like satisfaction, and when I went home I couldn't shut up about how I was "doing CrossFit."



But over the course of the next two weeks, something shifted. What started as a desire to become FIT AND STRONG (i.e., skinny and hot) sort of changed into being about making my coach and the people in my class like me, and about looking forward to being around them, in just a goofy, simple way. Because it was clear from the get-go that I couldn't keep up, exercise-level-wise, and that almost everything had to be amended to fit my physical limitations. But that was kind of freeing, because the workouts were still exhausting; it just wasn't so terrifying or comparison-based. And it was nice to just be in a room with some new people, doing a new thing, looking like an idiot.

'Whales' and dolphins may work together

Cetacean relationships False killer whales and bottlenose dolphins in New Zealand form long-term partnerships that might help them fend off predators or find food, researchers suggest.

Masters student Jochen Zaeschmar, and colleagues, from Massey University's Coastal-Marine Research Group, report their findings in a recent issue of Mammal Review.

"There is a long-term association between, not just the two species, but between actual individuals," says Zaeschmar.

False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) are actually a rare type of dolphin that are sometimes found together with bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).

But, until now there has been little research to investigate whether this association is just a matter of coincidence, or whether there issomething more to it.

"The first time I ever saw them together I was intrigued straight away because it seemed to be not random," says Zaeschmar. "They were so happy in each others' company. It was almost like it was one species."

False killer whales are three times the volume and two times the length of bottle nose dolphins and are jet black rather than grey.

Fin identification system

In a study spanning 17 years and 700 kilometres of territory in New Zealand waters, Zaeschmar and colleagues studied the movements of 61 false killer whales and 200 bottle nose dolphins, identifying individual animals by unique markings on their fins.

"There are nicks and notches and cuts in the backs of their fin that they accumulate over time - and they're permanent," says Zaeschmar. "We produced an identification catalogue for each species."

The study was challenging, with researchers having to get up close to take photos of the fins while the animals were moving in the open ocean.

But the findings have been worth the trouble.

"Not only are we seeing the same whales over and over again, but also the same dolphins," says Zaeschmar.

"They basically do everything together. They feed together, they travel together, they rest together. We have not seen any physical state where they have not been together."

The animals also have physical contact and have been known to produce viable hybrids in captivity.

"It's a pretty exciting thing that these relationships last much longer than we thought," says Zaeschmar.

Safety in numbers

Zaeschmar offers a number of theories as to why this long-term association exists.

One idea is that there is safety in numbers - the more individuals there are in a group, the more eyes there are looking out for predators, and if a predator does come, the less chance there is of any one individual being chosen.

"It's a win-win," says Zaeschmar.

Another idea is that joining forces makes it easier to spot food sources. In the open ocean food can be tricky to find, but is usually in great abundance once it is found, he says.

"There may also be just a strong social component," adds Zaeschmar.

He says the animals have similar vocalisations so it stands to reason they can communicate with each other, and the two have also been known to hybridise in captivity.

But, says Zaeschmar, it is very difficult to test the different hypotheses because the animals are always together.

The study was only able to observe the false killer whales and bottle nose dolphins during the period of December to May, when the animals are assumed to be following warmer currents in search of food.

Zaeschmar says his team has no idea where the animals go during the other months of the year but future studies could use satellite tagging to investigate whether the animals continue to associate with each other during this time.

False killer whales were originally confused with real killer whales in the 1800s because of similarities in their skull structure. The animals also have big teeth like killer whales.

And it is a curious fact that in some parts of the world they sometimes eat other dolphins or whales, says Zaeschmar.

"In New Zealand they obviously have a very different relationship with dolphins, which all adds to the mystery," he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000741-005dbf0e2ce8d14e13aa28c45311d185.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002747 00000000000 015061  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        VIDEO: Antifa Leftists Surround Conservative Journalist Lauren Southern – Throw FOX URINE On Her

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) delivered a letter Saturday afternoon to Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), signed by 43 Republicans, declaring that Reid’s debt-limit legislation was unacceptable. Needing 60 votes to clear a filibuster hurdle, Reid’s current draft is assured of failure in a 1 a.m. vote Sunday.

McConnell demanded that President Obama re-engage in negotiations. “It isn’t going to pass, let’s get talking to the administration,” McConnell said Saturday in a floor speech.

House GOP leaders had won narrow approval of a plan to raise the federal debt limit Friday after revising the measure to appeal to rebellious conservatives, but it was quickly shot down in the Senate, where Democrats began pushing their own plan to avert a national default.

Heading into the final weekend before the Treasury expects to begin running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills, Reid introduced a new version of his plan to grant the government additional borrowing authority into 2013, setting up the crucial Sunday morning vote in the Senate.

Democrats conceded that they still lack the votes to repel a GOP filibuster. Reid beseeched his Republican counterpart, McConnell, to join him in reworking the measure so the Senate could pass it and send it back to the House before slumping financial markets open Monday morning.

But in a phone call Friday evening, McConnell told Reid he wanted the White House at the table and expressed frustration that President Obama had rejected an emerging compromise between the two Senate leaders last weekend. Aides said McConnell expected to speak with administration officials Friday night and tamped down talk of an impasse. But Senate Democratic leaders reacted with outrage, accusing McConnell of blocking a deal.

“Unless there is a compromise or they accept my bill, we’re headed for economic disaster,” Reid said.

The late-night jousting in the Senate followed a vote on House Speaker John A. Boehner’s debt-limit measure, which would extend the Treasury’s borrowing power until early next year and force another economy-rattling fistfight within a few months.

Drafted largely by aides to Reid and McConnell last weekend, the measure was originally designed to appeal to the more centrist Senate. But Boehner (R-Ohio) could not rally enough support from his tea-party-influenced caucus and had to rewrite it at the 11th hour to add a provision that would compel Congress to adopt a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.

The change swayed a handful of holdouts, and the measure passed 218 to 210, with every Democrat and more than 20 Republicans voting no. But the episode was a loss of face for the speaker and his leadership team, demonstrating a lack of clout within their own conference. Even their allies in the Senate were stunned.

“Yes, people can be critical of what we’ve done, but where are the other ideas?” Boehner said on the House floor. “At this point in time, the House is going to act and we’re going to act together.”

Ultimately, it was for naught. Within two hours, the Senate tabled the measure, 59 to 41, with six conservative Republicans joining all 53 senators in the Democratic caucus in voting against the bill.

Throughout the day, senators in both parties held out hope for a bipartisan compromise to resolve the relatively small, but significant, differences between the House and Senate bills.

“We’ve gone through all this acrimony. It’s been painful for everybody to watch, I know,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) “But I’m very confident that soon we’re going to get to a place where we’ll have a bill that can pass both chambers. And I’m totally confident that the American people have nothing to worry about as it relates to Tuesday.”



Before the House vote, President Obama added to the chorus calling for compromise. He argued that the two parties are not “miles apart” and that he was prepared to work “all weekend long until we find a solution.”

At their core, the House and Senate bills are strikingly similar, having emerged from the same bipartisan talks last weekend. Both call for cutting deeply into agency budgets over the next decade and creating a new 12-member committee of lawmakers tasked with identifying trillions of dollars in additional cuts by the end of this year.

But Reid’s bill would justify a larger increase in the debt limit by counting more than $1 trillion in savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, savings Republicans dismiss as an accounting gimmick.

Boehner’s bill would give the Treasury a much shorter reprieve and require the committee to come up with $1.8 trillion in additional savings before the government could be granted additional borrowing power.

A new version of the legislation Reid unveiled Friday went a small part of the way to bridging the difference by aligning the size of the debt-limit increase and the spending cuts at $2.4 trillion. He kept the war savings, a sticking point for Republicans, but added a two-stage process for Obama to raise the debt limit without explicit congressional approval.

In brief remarks at the White House, Obama said the two sides are “in rough agreement” about the size of the first round of spending cuts and “the next step” to rein in borrowing. “If we need to put in place some kind of enforcement mechanism to hold us all accountable for making these reforms, I’ll support that, too, if it’s done in a smart and balanced way,” Obama said.

Future cuts

Talks have been underway for weeks about how to structure a plan so that both parties are encouraged to engage seriously in negotiations over future debt reduction. Democrats want to require both tax hikes and across-the-board spending cuts — which would be unattractive to many lawmakers — if the committee refuses to come up with recommendations for added savings. But Republicans have rejected any trigger that includes a tax hike.

On Friday, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, said the design of that mechanism “is what all the negotiations are about.” He added, “That’s going to part of the endgame.”

Without such an agreement, Obama warned that the United States stands to lose its sterling AAA credit rating — “not because we didn’t have the capacity to pay our bills. We do. But because we didn’t have a triple-A political system to match our triple-A credit rating.”

Obama again urged Americans to contact their representatives, clogging Capitol Hill switchboards for a second time this week. The White House also tweeted a number of Twitter handles for Republican lawmakers so voters could press them to “get past this.”

The president’s lobbying campaign appeared to have little effect in the House, where attempts by Boehner to move toward the center were forcefully rebuffed.

GOP divisions

Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had staked their personal reputations on the ability to deliver an all-Republican majority for the legislation.

They explained to their rank and file that despite broad Republican support in the House for a balanced-budget amendment, an earlier bill including the proposal could not pass the Senate. And the leaders pleaded with GOP lawmakers to support Boehner’s legislation, arguing that a majority for the bill would give McConnell leverage to push it through the Senate — or at least to force concessions from Reid.

Aides described the vote on the bill as nothing short of a vote of confidence in the leadership. All three leaders predicted victory.

But Thursday night, they were still short by as many as a dozen votes. So they pulled the bill and rewrote it to meet the demands of the conservative rebels. The balanced-budget amendment was put back into the bill.

For 23 hours, neither Boehner nor any other Republican leader issued a formal statement or paused in the Capitol hallways to explain to reporters what had happened. On Friday, a chastened Boehner spoke in favor of the rewrite and defended his earlier effort to cut a far-reaching debt-reduction deal with Obama.

“I stuck my neck out a mile to try to get an agreement with the president of the United States. I stuck my neck out a mile,” Boehner said. “But a lot of people in this town can never say yes.”

Democrats openly mocked Boehner’s inability to lead his caucus.

“He didn’t have a plan. By Tuesday, they announced they couldn’t call a vote. Well, maybe Wednesday. No, on Wednesday, they couldn’t call a vote. And then on Thursday, again, they failed to have the majority to call a vote. And so we waited,” Durbin told reporters.

Even some Senate Republicans were perplexed by the disarray in the House.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) re-affirmed his criticism of the balanced-budget amendment as “bizarro.”

And Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who served under Boehner in House leadership until his election to the Senate last year, said the rewritten House bill “may be more of a repeat” of the failed “cut, cap, balance” approach championed by conservatives “instead of a movement to being part of the solution.”

Boehner was “upbeat” during a luncheon with Senate Republicans, participants said, but senators exiting the meeting readily conceded that the House bill would not survive in the Senate. Blunt said talks were focused on finding a compromise that could pass the Democratic Senate and win support from a majority of Boehner’s Republicans.

“Not all of his members, but a majority,” Blunt said.

Boehner is likely to suffer defections if he brings up a Senate-passed compromise, and he would need House Democrats to fill in the gaps — a difficult position for him politically. But GOP senators said they believe Boehner stands ready to do what it takes to avoid a default.

“I think things are moving better than they appear to be moving,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). “There’s agreement on cuts. And there’s almost unanimous knowledge that default is not in the cards. That’s the heart of the issue. The rest of it’s details.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000676-edad1dc9b123212f15edfc4977f43f80.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015326 00000000000 015254  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The author tells Tom Kington in Rome that the comedian, who finds himself kingmaker of the Italian government, is taking his cues from medieval comics who bedevilled the powerful

What makes Beppe Grillo tick? After a quarter of Italians voted for his brand of populist insurgency in last week's general election, it is a question preoccupying the country's political class and much of the eurozone. According to Italy's most distinguished playwright and prominent Grillo supporter, the answer is simple.

"Grillo is like a character in one of my plays," says Dario Fo, whose satires on medieval and modern life have seen him handed a Nobel prize and hounded off Italian stages in a career that has covered 50 years. "He is from that school of medieval minstrels who played with paradox and the absurd," adds Fo.

Fo, 86, is best known for his play Accidental Death of an Anarchist, inspired by the death of a man in police custody in 1969, and has long been a leftwing hero in Italy. He publicly backed Grillo this year, co-writing a book on the comedian's fledgling political movement and giving him a ringing endorsement at a packed rally in Milan's Piazza Duomo days before the election.

In return, Grillo, 64, suggested that Fo be nominated as the next president of Italy, an offer that the playwright turned down.

The high-profile backing contributed to a campaign that achieved an astonishing momentum. As a result of the 8.7 million votes Grillo received, his movement is now the biggest single party in the chamber of deputies, which makes him a kingmaker in a hung parliament.

After building a cult following through his blog, which denounced the austerity drive of the former prime minister, Mario Monti, and dubbed ex-president Silvio Berlusconi "a saliva salesman" and "the psycho-dwarf", Grillo's breakthrough before the election came when middle-class professionals started to see him as the best way to express their alienation from Italy's self-perpetuating political class.

Experts and analysts have been drumming up ideas about new political paradigms in Italy ever since. Journalists mobbed Grillo all last week for clues as to what comes next. His only response so far has been to refuse an offer from Italy's centre-left Democratic party to work together in parliament, using characteristically earthy language to describe the party's leader Pier Luigi Bersani as an "arse face". On Saturday he said he would accept a centre-left alliance with Berlusconi, only to add "they will never do it."

For Fo, the key to understanding Grillo is not in 21st-century Italy but in the 13th century, when storytellers – giullari – roamed Italy, entertaining crowds in piazzas with lewd and ancient tales interwoven with satirical attacks on local potentates.

"In English the equivalent word is 'juggler', but in Italy they juggled with words, irony and sarcasm," says Fo, who has attended Grillo's shows for years.

Grillo rose to fame mixing comedy routines with references to political scandals in the towns he was playing in, a straight lift from his medieval peers.

"He is from the tradition of the wise storyteller, one who knows how to use surreal fantasy, who can turn situations around, who has the right word for the right moment, who can transfix people when he speaks, even in the rain and the snow," explains Fo.

At one rain-soaked pre-election rally in Viterbo, in Lazio, central Italy, Grillo yelled: "Put down your umbrellas, I want to look you in the face." The crowd duly obeyed the comedian's demand.

Even the internet-based forums where Grillo's followers argue over policy have their roots in the Middle Ages, argues Fo. He says: "We had extremely democratic town councils in medieval Italy which knew the value of working together and every now and then, down the centuries, this spirit returns."

Grillo's focus on the web followed his ejection from Italian state TV in the 1980s after he made fun of corrupt Italian Socialist politicians, a few years before many of them were rounded up during Italy's Clean Hands probe.

His TV ban was part of a proud tradition, says Fo. "Nothing has changed since the Emperor Frederick II issued a decree in the 13th century against giullari who criticised power."

Fo himself was thrown off state TV in 1951 after he adapted biblical tales as political satire, the start of a series of run-ins with Italy's fascists, communists and the Vatican as his radical theatre group challenged taboos.

By 2004, Fo was being sued by an associate of Berlusconi after he staged a satire that poked fun at Berlusconi's small stature. "Every time you touch those who have power over the media, they seek to stop you," he says.

As a young man in Milan during the second world war, Fo helped his father – a resistance fighter – smuggle escaped British prisoners of war into Switzerland and his memories flooded back when he was invited on stage by Grillo at the Milan rally.

"The end of the war was the last time I saw that piazza filled with the same joy, with people changing their way of thinking about politics," he says.

Fo draws a parallel between Grillo's Five Star Movement's attack on Italy's privileged political class and the activists he worked with in the late 1960s. "Back then, people were also realising the importance of culture, of schools, and a generation of Italian singer-songwriters were giving voice to that."

The difference is that those artists never held the balance of power in Italy as Grillo does, with 162 deputies and senators under his movement's control in parliament. Now, after his election triumph, Grillo faces the challenges of real politics.

The first came last week when thousands of supporters urged him to form a functioning government with the centre-left leader, Bersani, who needs his backing in the senate to reach a majority.

"It is not easy, the Democratic party treated Grillo with disrespect, called him a fascist, a buffoon, but now they are offering their hand," says Fo, who is actively encouraging Grillo to negotiate, meaning that a playwright and a comic were making Italy's political headlines at the end of the week.

In Sicily, where the Democratic party runs the regional council but Grillo's movement is the biggest party, the two have formed a cagey alliance. "This is the model, it is working," explains Fo.

The real trap for Grillo, warns Fo, is being beguiled by flattery. Turning again to history, he cites Cola Di Rienzo, the charismatic son of a tavern owner in the 14th century who wooed Romans with his oratory and became the city's leader, setting his sights high and ousting corrupt noble families, only to see his support slip away before he was murdered by a mob as he sought to flee in disguise.

"I have seen the glowing press for Grillo and he must be careful not to fall for the adulation, it's a honey-like trap."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0000757-5435b579cca34aae9ef9caf068326594.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012425 00000000000 015130  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The story of A. B. and the training of the IT worker's H-1B replacement struck a chord with Computerworld readers. It provided an opportunity for them to vent, argue and share their views about the visa and its impact on U.S. workers.

More than 3,400 people commented on the story, and many sent in emails as well. There were a number of major themes in these responses.

Four of them follow:

One: "There was never actually a rule that they (an employer) had to prove there was no qualified American." Aging Hipster.

Aging Hipster is correct. There is no requirement that companies try to find a qualified U.S. worker before filling a position with an H-1B visa holder.

The U.S. Labor Dept. writes: "The H-1B employer is not required to recruit U.S. workers, unless it is H-1B-dependent."

What does H-1B "dependent" mean? A firm that has 51 or more full-time equivalent employees of whom 15% or more are H-1B visa holder is classified as dependent.

H-1B dependent employers, which include all the major offshore outsourcing providers, "must take good faith steps to recruit U.S. workers for any job for which they seek H-1B workers," according to the Labor Dept. But there are loopholes.

H-1B dependent firms can sidestep the "good faith" hiring rule if they pay their visa-holding workers at least $60,000, or hire a foreign engineer holding an advanced degree.

H-1B workers must be paid the prevailing wage, but the employer that brings in an offshore firm will pay a blended rate that accounts for the differences in U.S. and overseas salaries. Employees overseas are typically paid a fraction of a U.S. salary.

At the start of a contract an offshore outsourcing firm may bring in quite a few H-1B workers to a worksite, but the long-term goal will be to have about 20% of the workers onshore, and 80% offshore. These percentages can vary widely depending on the type of work.

Two: "Sadly, this is all too common." JPRZ.

JPRZ is correct. Offshore outsourcing firms are taking more than 50% of the annual base H-1B visa cap of 65,000. Another 20,000 visas are set aside for advanced degree graduates of U.S. schools.

The two largest H-1B users in 2013 were both Indian-based -- Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services.

Three: "I want these visas eliminated." Email.

A middle aged Florida woman, who believes she lost her telecom job to an H-1B visa holder, wrote to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) about last year's immigration bill that passed in the Senate. In response to A.B.'s story, she shared her correspondence.

The woman asked for anonymity to avoid jeopardizing her job search.

Her letter to Sen Rubio said in part: "I hope you experience the same kind of long-term gut-wrenching poverty and discrimination I am experiencing in the job market because of your corruption."

Rubio wrote back, in part: "As a United States Senator, I will keep your ideas and views in mind while working to promote principles and policies to benefit Floridians and Americans alike."

The Florida woman's frustration, and Rubio's boilerplate response, says something about the political disconnect on this issue. Rubio supports the increase in the H-1B cap included in the Senate immigration bill, with the belief there's a tech skills shortage in the U.S. "You can't grow the middle class if people do not have the skills to get hired for these jobs," said Rubio in 2012.

Rubio is hardly alone in supporting the need for H-1B visas. The Senate immigration bill would more than double the current visa cap. There is significant support from lawmakers in both parties for hiking the cap.

The H-1B visa is rarely raised by candidates in political campaigns There is little evidence that support for the visa hurts at the polls, though David Brat's Virginia primary victory over U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the House majority leader, may be an exception. Brat, an economics professor, focused his attacks on Cantor's stands on immigration issues, including the H-1B visa program.

Four: "This is nothing new. Your article is laughably behind the times." Cletus.

Cletus is correct. The H-1B visa turns 25 next year. The growth of offshore outsourcing as a threat to U.S. IT jobs began in earnest in the late 1990s.

H-1B visa use by IT services companies continues to grow, and visa holders are increasingly used for state and federal government work. A U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services inspector general recently reported that 11 state Medicaid agencies allow offshore outsourcing of administrative functions. H-1B visa workers are being used in government funded health care programs.

Meanwhile, offshore outsourcing firms continue to grow. Cognizant, a U.S.-based IT services firm, a large user of H-1B visas, reported that its revenue in 2013 grew to $8.84 billion, up more than 20% from 2012.

As long as people are forced to leave their jobs and train their visa holding replacements, such as A.B., the H-1B visa will remain one of the biggest stories in tech.

The tables were turned on a council CCTV "spy van" when a member of the public spotted it parking illegally, landing the driver a stiff reprimand.

Stuart Bonar photographed the van parked on a cycle lane and single yellow line in Marylebone.

Mr Bonar, a Liberal Democrat campaigner from Marylebone, said: "This is a victory for people power."

The central London council stopped using the driver after the "unacceptable" breach.

The vans uses cameras to scan number-plates of cars looking for vehicles with outstanding warrants on them.

Mr Bonar said: "Personally I don't like these creepy, East German-style spy vans.

"But if we are to have them then the least they can do is obey the law."

Councillor Lee Rowley, head of parking at the Conservative-run council, said: "I'd like to thank the person who brought this to our attention.

"The parking in this picture is absolutely unacceptable.

"As such, the contractor has been reprimanded and the particular driver of the vehicle will no longer work in Westminster going forward."

The council has faced a storm of protest after recently voting to charge for West End parking on Sundays and evenings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000750-c70727db23a622ca3980697578756a27.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005263 00000000000 014542  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        American Assets Trust says it's creating a neighborhood in Portland's Lloyd District, where the San Diego company is building apartments by the hundreds.

If that's the case, Phase Two would be the neighborhood's town square.

As its 657-apartment

, AAT is

to redevelopment of the four-block site just to the south. It would replace Oregon Square, a collection of low-rise office buildings, with four new high-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings.

And in the middle, the company is planning more than 100,000 square feet of open space. (That's nearly 14 times the size of downtown Portland's

, 2-1/2 Pioneer Courthouse squares and almost two football fields.) The privately owned park would be open to residents and anyone else.

"We definitely see it as being both an amenity and asset to the development, but also a destination," said Kyle Anderson of GBD Architects, which is designing the project.

The idea had its origins in a negotiation with the Portland Parks Bureau. AAT proposed using the portion of its development fees that would go toward new parks to build one on-site. The company would build the park, then hand the deed over to the city.

The talks fell apart, but AAT kept the idea for the public space, anyway.

"The Lloyd District doesn't have a city park," said AAT Vice President Wade Lange, adding that nearby Holladay Park is technically in the Sullivan's Gulch neighborhood. "As more people move here ... that's going to be a glaring miss on our part."

The space would be owned and managed by AAT, which would have staff on-site 24 hours a day. It would host events for its residents and for the general public.

Oregon Square is already home to the Lloyd District's year-round farmer's market, frequented mostly by people working the surrounding office towers. More than 11,000 people work within three blocks, AAT says. (They haven't yet hammered out an agreement to keep the farmer's market there, but Lange said it would be a good fit.)

"We know that's an opportunity during the workday to capture a group of people who are looking to get out of their buildings," Lange said.

Like downtown's Director Park, the Oregon Square plaza would sit atop a parking garage. It would include a covered area and a fountain that could be turned off to make more room for events.

The plaza would be surrounded by four residential buildings. Anderson, the architect, said his firm has been careful to create a "porous" design, where people could access the space either through the wide gaps between buildings or through retail storefronts that be accessible from either the sidewalk or the plaza.

AAT plans to start construction at Oregon Square in spring or summer of 2016.

Not that the CBS executive chairman and CEO might vote for the Republican presidential frontrunner, but he likes the ad money Trump and his competitors are bringing to the network.

"It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS," he said of the presidential race.

Moonves called the campaign for president a "circus" full of "bomb throwing," and he hopes it continues.

"Most of the ads are not about issues. They're sort of like the debates," he said.

"Man, who would have expected the ride we're all having right now? ... The money's rolling in and this is fun," he said.

"I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going," said Moonves.

Bjork has rushed her eighth album Vulnicura onto iTunes, days after the music leaked online.

The album's release was intended to accompany a retrospective of the Icelandic musician's career at New York's Museum of Modern Art in March.

But after the record appeared on file-sharing sites last weekend, the star decided to put it on sale immediately.

"I am so grateful you are still interested in my work," she said. "I appreciate every little bit!"

Writing on Facebook, Bjork described the nine-track album as "a complete heartbreak album" with an "emotional chronology" to it.

"I was worried it would be too self indulgent," said the star, who later realised the songs "could be a help, a crutch to others and prove how biological this process is: The wound and the healing of the wound, psychologically and physically".

She added: "It has a stubborn clock attached to it."

'Devastating' leaks

Bjork's fast turnaround echoes that of Madonna, who raced to get tracks from her Rebel Heart album onto iTunes over Christmas after early demos and unfinished mixes appeared online.

Speaking to Billboard magazine last month, Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, described the situation as "devastating".

"[We were] trying to pull down as many leaks as we could and... it was just unstoppable," he said.

"So, Madonna was pretty adamant that we should go immediately, that we should put out as much of the finished music as we could. And there was a lot of talk about the many reasons why it didn't make sense...

"But she was adamant that she didn't want people to think those were the finished tracks.

"And she was devastated. I mean, devastated and sickened that someone would do this to her and not allow her the chance to share the finished product with people."

Other artists have taken extreme measures to stop their albums leaking.

Beyonce took the world by surprise when she released her self-titled fifth album on iTunes overnight in 2013, complete with 17 music videos.

To keep the process under wraps, the record had been codenamed "Lily" and staff at her record label, Columbia, were only told of its existence the day before it was released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0000770-4aee42a012c3df271723e2e242046afb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011330 00000000000 015044  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        MILWAUKEE -- The one thing missing from a Cleveland Cavaliers season that has seemingly had it all so far has been a collective confidence shared by the team’s key components in where they all believed everything was moving in the right direction.

There are various reasons for this phenomenon existing on a squad that now is a 56-22 team after Tuesday’s 109-80 dismantling of the Milwaukee Bucks: Early season injuries, warped expectations caused by the Golden State Warriors' unprecedented success, David Blatt’s firing and LeBron James' sometimes distracting social media habits all receive check marks. But finally, with just four games remaining before the playoffs begin, that confidence is unmistakably present.

“We’ve had some ups and downs, but for the most part, we’ve had way more ups, and for our team, we’re in a good place right now with a week and a half left in the regular season,” said James after putting up 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting, nine assists and five rebounds in just three quarters. “It’s a perfect time to be clicking, and we’re clicking right now, so it’s perfect for our team, and everyone feels in a good rhythm offensively and defensively. We know what we want to do, and we can go out and execute that.”

There are three numbers that stick out the most about the win in Milwaukee, and they all tell a different story about why the Cavs feel good about themselves right now: 197, 30 and 40.

The 197 signifies J.R. Smith's number of 3-point field goals this season after he hit 7-of-11 from deep against the Bucks. He came into the game needing to hit three 3s to pass Wesley Person’s franchise record of 192 made 3s in the season. He set the record with ease.

“Coming into the game, we talked about him breaking the single-season record for the Cavs,” Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. “That was on everyone’s mind, and LeBron said, ‘I’m going to come out and I’m going to get it to you in the first quarter,’ and he got it in the first quarter. So, that’s what great teammates do. Everyone was happy for him, and he shot the ball great tonight.”

The Smith record is significant because not only did it give the Cavs a game within the game to concentrate on against the type of inferior opponent that they have failed to get up for in the past, but it also was another example of Lue imploring his team to celebrate the little victories over the course of the 82-game grind in order to bring levity to the process.

The next number, 30, represents the Cavs’ assist total for the night, on 41 buckets. Seven players took five or more shots and no one took more than 12, and the ball zipped around the court from side to side, creating open opportunities all night.

“I mean, it’s my type of basketball,” said James, who had fewer than 10 attempts for just the second time this season. “I love when the ball is moving. I couldn’t care less about how many shots I get as long as the ball is moving and everybody is in a good rhythm and guys feel good about the offensive end. It definitely shows up on the defensive end, as well.”

Which brings us to the final number, 40, representing the field goal percentage the Cavs were able to hold the Bucks under, as Milwaukee shot just 39.8 percent from the field.

That type of defensive and offensive output makes the Cavs virtually unbeatable. They are now 16-0 this season when holding their opponent under 40 percent shooting and 6-0 this season when handing out 30 assists or more.

“I thought this was like one of our most complete games of the season for us -- offense and defense and having both of them for the whole game,” Lue said.

When informed of Lue’s comment, Kyrie Irving -- who finished with 15 points and six assists and didn’t even attempt a shot in the first quarter as Cleveland jumped out to a 33-19 lead -- said, “That’s a bold statement for us.”

Irving's insinuation was: It’s about damn time. The NBA season is a long one. Probably too long. To get too caught up in one’s momentum, or lack thereof, with the playoffs still months away is folly.

All a team can ask for is to be playing the right way when it’s time to be the first team to 16 postseason wins. From James to Irving to Smith to Kevin Love continuing his recent strong play with 17 points and nine rebounds in just 25 minutes in Milwaukee, the Cavaliers clearly can claim that.

“It’s all about us,” Lue said. “I think when we have the right approach coming into the game both offensively and defensively, wanting to move the ball, share the ball, I think we’re tough to beat. So I just think it’s us, mentally, having to come in with that approach.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000788-44e078005979f63a00a8917672ceeed3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011227 00000000000 014710  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Activision announced major changes to its competitive Call of Duty structure Wednesday, including a reformatting of its Call of Duty World League Pro League and the creation of an amateur-level division, as well as a a competitive season prize pool larger than any in Call of Duty history for 2017-18.

It's part an overall push from Activision to further promote the burgeoning esport, with Michael Condrey, Co-Founder and Studio Head at Sledgehammer Games, suggesting this will be "the most invested the studio has ever been in esports." The prize pool for the year, Activision said, is around $4.2 million.

"We felt like we had to, from Day One, build a studio initiative to support Call of Duty esports," Condrey said.

The Call of Duty World League will now be split into two divisions of eight teams that compete in an LAN setting in two separate stages, Stage 1 and 2. Qualifying teams will compete at the MLG Arena in Columbus, Ohio, at least twice in a season for a spot in the playoffs and a shot at its $500,000 prize pool.

The previous format gave the top 16 teams with the most Pro Points accrued worldwide a spot in Stage 1, and those teams were put in in one of four pools of LAN competition at the MLG Arena in Columbus, Ohio, over the course of a given weekend. The top two teams from each pool then earned a spot in the Stage 1 playoffs, with the process repeating itself for Stage 2 and Stage 2 playoffs, respectively.

This season, Stage 1 will be played out Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of every week from Jan. 23 to March 22, with the playoffs taking place on April 6. Stage 2 will repeat the same format from May 15 through July 19 with the playoffs on July 27.

Kevin Flynn, Director of Call of Duty Esports, cites experiences from past iterations of the CWL as a chance for growth instead of falling into a bit of stagnation.

"I think the CWL is the manifestation of the franchise's commitment to esports," said Kevin Flynn, Director of Call of Duty Esports, "and I think on our journey from year to year, we are learning and getting better. The product and viewing experience is becoming slicker."

Teams unable to qualify for Stage 1 or 2 will automatically slot into the CWL National Circuit, a new layer of the competitive season designated to enhance the amateur-level talent in Call of Duty. The CWL National Circuit will take place in eight regions -- Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States -- with teams competing against their regional competition for a first-place prize package that includes an invitation to an upcoming Global Open event plus paid travel accommodations, a $1,000 cash prize and 3,000 Pro Points to each player.

The CWL National Circuit will have four stages, with the first taking place from Jan. 26 to Feb. 16.

"We know we have a wealth of teams and players that are trying to compete and get to that elite level. If you aren't one of those teams to qualify for the specific stages, you'll get a chance to compete online regularly," Flynn said. "We feel what this is doing is providing a really great angle for players' aspirations. For players and teams to keep shooting for, and competing against, the teams at the top of the level and hopefully broaden the reach of the CWL and build up the competition globally."

Pro Points will be earned in a similar manner to last season, with teams competing in both LAN and online tournaments as well as through daily competition on GameBattles. Unlike last year, there will be a hard cap placed on the amount of Pro Points earned in a given day (35) through GameBattles in an effort to promote healthier playstyles across the scene. Players can immediately begin earning Pro Points starting Nov. 3 upon release of Call of Duty: World War II.

Fifteen online regional tournaments known as 2K because of the amount of Pro Points awarded to each individual player (2,000) on the winning team, will take place throughout the course of the season, with some also expected to have a minor prize pool as well. There will also be six major LAN Global Open events during the 2017-18 competitive year. The first will take place from Dec. 8-10 in Dallas, with another scheduled for Jan. 12-14 in New Orleans and the third March 9-11 in Atlanta. The prize pool for each open LAN major is expected to be $200,000.

The Call of Duty World Championships structure remains unchanged, with 32 teams expected to qualify for the $1.5 million event. Sources suggest the event is likely to begin in August, but the location has yet to be determined.

Call of Duty: World War II launches Nov. 3 and will take the franchise back to its roots with the boots-on-the-ground movement system returning after a multi-year hiatus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0000688-27d1c0ace8e5d328a5fc45d1df046e52.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000041544 00000000000 015252  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Out with the old, in with the … old.

On February 13, Michel Therrien was replaced as head coach of the Montreal Canadiens by Claude Julien. Again.

I was there in Philadelphia, when it all started. At least that’s what I’d like to think.

I certainly didn’t expect to see the game that unfolded. Coming off a strong post-All-Star-break performance against a weak Buffalo Sabres team, the Canadiens generated only 16 shots in their 3-1 loss to the Flyers.

The Flyers, after their preceding sloppy outing against the Carolina Hurricanes, benched (sorry, “healthy-scratched for development purposes”) Shayne Gostisbehere and Travis Konecny against the Habs, replacing them with Nick Schultz and former Hab (and EOTP Goalie Analyst favourite) Dale Weise. Philly’s Dave Hakstol essentially sold out to a defense-first, offense-optional lineup, hoping to generate a few chances by Claude Giroux and Jakub Voracek, capitalize on a mistake or a power play, and win a tight, low-scoring game.

That’s exactly what happened. Giroux tied the game at the end of the second period on the power play from Andrew Shaw’s now-infamous interference penalty on Nick Cousins, Matt Read beat Carey Price off the rush early in the third, and Sean Couturier sealed the deal with an empty-netter. Obviously, the plan worked. Essentially, Dave Hakstol out-Therriened Therrien.

By the end of the night, I was determined to sound a warning bell that things were not right, and that it was time to storm the Montreal Management Foxhole with torches and pitchforks.

Ok, that was a little dramatic. I wish I could say that I saw this coming. I really do. Clearly, I didn’t.

I don't think Claude deserved that. However, I'm guessing his next coaching gig will have substantially better weather. #NHL #Julien #Bruins — aka Ken (@Minivan_Dad) February 7, 2017

I did decide that based on what I saw that night, the Habs’ chances of a deep playoff run were doomed, and that I was going to foray outside of goaltending microanalysis to explain what I saw and why it mattered.

For the record, I’m a huge proponent of advanced analytics, but I rarely write about them. There are plenty of brilliant folks doing that very well, on here and out there. At the risk of oversimplifying, in 2014-15 the Habs outperformed their underlying metrics because of Carey Price. Last year, their underlying analytics were dismissed because of his absence. This year, their metrics were improved early on, but failing after their early start. The Habs’ organizational relationship with the analytics community has been, well, rocky. Obviously, the lightning rod for the conversation was P.K. Subban (my personal feelings about him are here) and the trade for Shea Weber, but the effective swap of Lars Eller for Andrew Shaw also clearly illustrated management’s intentions.

"We are very pleased to have agreed to a long-term deal with Andrew Shaw. As I mentioned last Friday following his acquisition, we are adding a solid character player to our team, a reliable player who plays with grit and a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Chicago Blackhawks over the past five seasons. Andrew will add more leadership to our team.” -Marc Bergevin

Beginning in Philadelphia, the cracks in the triangular foundation of the off-season — Weber, Shaw, and the vote of confidence for Therrien that they represented — were exposed. The Habs stumbled into the bye week with a record of 1-5-1 for the month of February. Their only win, in Arizona on February 9, came despite one of the strangest performances from Carey Price anyone will ever see, and followed a “leadership meeting” that didn’t include the head coach. (Yes, everybody says it had nothing to do with the subsequent coaching change. No, nobody actually believes that).

By the end of the 4-0 debacle in Boston on February 12, with Weber and Shaw signed long-term and Claude Julien suddenly on the market, Marc Bergevin realized the train had left the station.

So what do I think Bergevin saw in the Wells Fargo Center that Thursday night, which was, appropriately, Groundhog Day?

Shea Weber

I think it’s important to begin with Weber, and the defensive system that is built around him. I hadn’t seen Weber play in person before. It reminded me of watching a 16-year-old midget player in a non-league game for his kid brother’s bantam team, brought in because the team is one person short. In case anyone isn’t aware, he’s big. He’s also much more than that. He is a physically dominant player in the defensive zone, and along the offensive blue line. His individual defensive abilities are impressive. He's a smart possession player in the defensive zone, capable of protecting the puck in space and finding a safe outlet pass.

In other words, he is exactly what Therrien and the Habs management wanted when they traded Subban for him.

In Philadelphia, he patrolled the back end like a defensive sweeper on a soccer field, and he engaged bodies in front of the net. He never took a risk that put him out of his expected position. Against Edmonton on February 4, even Connor McDavid, with his size and remarkable speed, couldn’t elude Weber’s physical presence. Fulfilling Michel Therrien’s expectations the way he did, though, was a double-edged sword. The downside is that as formidable as he is, he was also extremely predictable in his role.

Edmonton, specifically McDavid and Patrick Maroon, showed he can be vulnerable to a pressure forecheck when he has to turn his back to the ice below the goal line. Granted, that’s true of almost any NHL defenceman, but with Weber there just isn’t the threat that he’s going to attempt any kind of high-risk/high-reward play. As soon as he turns his back in deep, it’s a license to attack.

The Flyers used a similar tactic at times. At others, however, they did the opposite, in that they seemed content to let Weber make a safe outlet pass with only light forecheck pressure. It looked like the alternate plan, at least to my spectator’s eye at the end of the ice, was only to influence which direction the first pass went, then clog up the neutral zone and prevent any kind of entry speed across the blue line. It wasn't quite as boring as a trap, because the Flyers seemed to be looking to generate turnovers and counter-attack rather than simply force a dump-in.

It makes perfect sense as a numbers game. With Weber looking to make a first pass from below the faceoff circles, two main things happened. He wasn’t a factor to create transition through the neutral zone, and as long as there was at least a single forechecker, his defence partner had to remain back for support. His first pass either went to an area of the neutral zone that the Flyers influenced, or to his supporting defensive partner.

Either way, by the time the Habs forwards received the puck in the neutral zone and tried to execute a zone entry, they were outnumbered, with Weber and his D partner only regarded as trailers and release valves. As a result, the Habs weren't able to generate the attacking rushes that make a player like Max Pacioretty so dangerous in transition.

Here’s an example with Alex Galchenyuk, Andrew Shaw, and David Desharnais on the ice with Weber, in which the Flyers are able to make a full change and still completely outnumber the forwards on the attempted entry.

When the Habs were able to gain offensive-zone possession, they encountered similar problems.

It comes down to positioning and spacing. This was particularly true for the top line, which Haskstol consistently countered with Sean Couturier’s excellent defence. The Canadiens’ defencemen, specifically including (but not limited to) Weber, appeared anchored at the blue line against a Flyers team that was determined not to allow Pacioretty to beat them from his preferred mid-range distances.

Alexander Radulov and Philip Danault spent a good amount of time effectively recovering the puck below the goal line, only to then have no clean passing option once they gained possession because of the close watch Philly kept on Pacioretty. When the puck was moved to the points, the large gap to the defencemen required either a long pass that allowed the Flyers forwards to close down shooting lanes, or an uncontrolled release pass that similarly allowed the defensive coverage to adjust, or compete for puck control.

For example, look at the spacing here with Jeff Petry, who most would consider as a more active defenceman than Weber.

That’s not to say Weber wasn’t active, because he was, it’s just that his mobility was contained within a limited range of space. This was most evident on the Habs’ lone man advantage of the night.

Again, it’s a question of predictability. Weber’s biggest scoring threat is his one-timer from his off-side on the power play. The problem is that everyone knows that; they know where it’s coming from, and they know how the Habs want to get him the puck. The Flyers, for the one minute of the first unit’s power play shift, took that away in two ways. One, by successfully disrupting zone entries, and two, by just not letting the Habs get Weber the puck cleanly.

In Sunday night’s debacle in Boston, the Bruins did the same thing. They forced Weber to vacate his preferred shooting position and remain in motion in order to receive the puck, thus rendering his primary scoring weapon ineffective. They were happy to let Pacioretty shoot, expectedly, from the face off circle to Tuukka Rask’s left rather than face Weber’s blasts.

The Flyers also demonstrated that Weber’s predictable instinct to play as a defensive sweeper can be used against him at the point of attack. Matt Read’s goal, for example, begins deep in the Flyers’ zone. Pacioretty’s forecheck on Nick Schultz (55) causes him to rush an errant pass toward Sean Couturier (14), which bounces off the boards well out of his reach. Weber, though, is already in conservative retreat despite his full view of the broken play in front of him.

Galchenyuk, marking Couturier toward the boards, doesn't yet realize that Weber is retreating. He sees the loose puck and the space, and begins to angle back into the offensive zone. This ultimately allows Couturier to gain position and momentum on him when the play continues out of the Flyers’ end. Nick Cousins (25), meanwhile, skates along the blue line toward the play.

Instead of being able to regenerate the possession by stepping up to the errant pass, Weber’s retreat allows Cousins space to intercept the puck, with speed.

Cousins has the time and space to control the puck along the boards, and face the centre of the ice. He is completely unfazed by Weber’s physical presence, because he already knows he’s caught #6 flat-footed.

Weber attempts to challenge Cousins, and it doesn't go well. A simple, short pass to Couturier completely eliminates Weber as a defensive factor, leaving Alexei Emelin to defend a 2-on-1 against Couturier and Matt Read.

Couturier makes an early pass to Read, and establishes inside position on Weber. Emelin is unable to recover, and Read snipes Price top blocker corner with the best shot of his NHL career for the game-winning goal.

This simple, small-area attack renders Weber’s toughness and one-on-one defensive abilities completely irrelevant — twice — by taking advantage of his defensive priority to retreat and regroup.

Overall, the Flyers, in the midst of their own crisis, were able to completely neutralize Weber at both ends of the ice. Whomever the Habs face in the playoffs certainly would have noticed. I thought specifically of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Flyers’ approach to outnumber the Habs forwards in the neutral zone, offensively challenge Weber with small-area speed at the point of attack, and add in a smattering of Edmonton’s forecheck would be right up their alley. Honestly, Therrien’s Habs wouldn’t have had a chance in a seven-game series.

Andrew Shaw

It’s well known that he was benched for the entire third period following his interference penalty on Nick Cousins that led to Claude Giroux’s game-tying power play goal. Therrien received considerable praise at the time for having the guts to bench a veteran like Shaw, in order to send a message that he needs to be more responsible.

I get it. Fans, and old-school hockey journalists, like to know that the coach is in charge of the millionaire players, and that the inmates aren’t running the asylum. The team comes before all else, and stupid penalties hurt the team. Except that the coach’s decision hurt the team more than Shaw’s penalty. It was a reactionary punishment by a disciplinarian coach, and that was exactly the problem.

Alex Galchenyuk was playing his second game after missing significant time with a knee injury. He looked strong enough skating, and it didn’t look like he was favouring anything, but he couldn’t be expected to have his usual explosive creativity or elusiveness. Clearly, the coaching staff thought the same thing, starting him with Shaw and David Desharnais, leaving Philip Danault to centre the top line with Pacioretty and Radulov.

Shaw’s third-period benching, therefore, filtered through the lineup on a night when expectations on Galchenyuk needed to be restrained. Galchenyuk isn’t a defensive stalwart at his best, and he’s not great on faceoffs, so he certainly couldn't be expected to anchor a line of Brian Flynn and Jacob de la Rose if necessary.

Danault is more versatile, particularly given that he was healthy, so he and Galchenyuk swapped roles. This required Galchenyuk, working back from an injury, to deal with the hard-matching against Couturier’s line that had already proven effective for two periods against a healthy Danault. Not unexpectedly, the top line generated nothing for the third period, nor did the remainder of the jumbled lineup. (As an aside, it bears mentioning that Therrien, notorious for his line-blending, never really separated Radulov and Pacioretty in an attempt to free at least one of them from the Flyers’ home-ice change advantage.)

Absolutely, Shaw’s penalty gave the Flyers the opportunity to tie the score in the final two minutes at the end of the second period. However, his benching reduced the Canadiens’ chances to win the game during the entire 20 minutes of the third period.

It didn't make sense from a strategic perspective, and it didn’t really make philosophical sense either. The Habs were playing the Flyers, a more physical team with less overall talent, who had been skated out of the rink in Carolina a few nights earlier. In response, they scratched their two most creative young offensive players against Montreal, replacing them with two guys who also brought more sandpaper than talent to the lineup. Brendan Gallagher hadn’t yet returned from his hand injury (sustained from a Weber slapshot; he’s tough to play against, and tough to play with) and Michael McCarron was in St John’s. Wasn't this exactly the kind of game for which management wanted Andrew Shaw rather than Lars Eller?

Shaw is an agitator. He takes dumb penalties. He is who he is. By the way, he can also score, and contributed significantly to two Stanley Cups during his time in Chicago. Oh, and he played for Joel Quenneville, who isn't exactly a pushover. What message could Therrien possibly send by benching him that Shaw doesn't already know? Why not just chew him out at the intermission, then let him go out and show some of that “character” and “leadership” by making up for his mistake? Sorry, I just don't get it. If Shaw needs to be benched for taking a dumb penalty in Philadelphia in early February, then why did Bergevin and Therrien sign him in the first place?

The beginning of the end

I’d like to think that as Bergevin watched this game unfold in Philadelphia, he saw the same things that I did. I’d like to think that he saw the offensive system stymied by a middle-of-the-road defensive team with a simple plan; that he watched his shiny new traditional stalwart defenceman be neutralized offensively and exposed defensively; that he watched his best hope for a top-line center be subjected to more stressful duty than was warranted in his second game back from a significant knee injury because of a punitive decision designed to teach a lesson to a guy who’s heard it a million times already; and that he watched the guy he had been asked to bring in for grit and leadership ride the bench for an entire period while his team struggled, and lost a winnable game.

I’d like to think that, watching the same game that I did, Bergevin came to the same unavoidable conclusion: he had constructed a team according to the specifications of his head coach — his good friend — Michel Therrien, and it just wasn't going to work.

Marc Bergevin knows that the Montreal Canadiens don’t play hockey just to make the playoffs. They play to win the Stanley Cup. It’s going to take more than Claude Julien to get this team back on track, but the journey had to start somewhere. I’d like to think that somewhere was right before my eyes in Philadelphia.                                                                                                                                                            0000550-d443678baa5fca0b8791b743d4923a2e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006323 00000000000 015100  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Image caption Richard O'Dwyer said he was glad the matter was over with

A student who was wanted by US authorities for breaking copyright laws has been ordered to pay £20,000 by a judge in New York.

Richard O'Dwyer, from Sheffield, signed a deferred prosecution agreement, in which he said he would not break any US laws.

The US authorities claimed the 24-year-old's TVShack website hosted links to pirated films and TV programmes.

If Mr O'Dwyer complies with the agreement, the case will be dropped.

He agreed to stay in touch with a correctional officer over a six-month period as part of the contract.

Mr O'Dwyer travelled to the US voluntarily after spending more than two years challenging whether he should be charged and extradited from the UK for copyright infringement.

'Finally over'

He entered the New York Southern District federal court with his mother, girlfriend and UK and US lawyers.

After the court appearance, Mr O'Dwyer told the BBC: "I'm happy it's finally over. I still maintain I never thought I was committing a crime.

This matter could have been dealt with over two years ago without the threat of extradition, which in my view is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut Julia O'Dwyer

"I'm glad the US has decided to drop the case. It's a pity the UK wasn't able to resolve this."

He added: "I'm looking forward to getting back to university and see all my friends."

Mr O'Dwyer's barrister Ben Cooper said in a statement: "So far as we know this is a first in extradition cases - and a sensible solution for UK defendants faced with an ever-growing extra-territorial reach of US prosecutions."

Mr O'Dwyer's mother Julia, who has campaigned tirelessly to stop her son being extradited, said: "We are very pleased and relieved to have been able to resolve this matter.

"We would like to thank the prosecutors who have been willing to engage in dialogue and recognise that this conduct did not merit the extradition, incarceration and criminalisation of my son.

"This matter could have been dealt with over two years ago without the threat of extradition, which in my view is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut."

Repay victims

Earlier this year Home Secretary Theresa May approved Mr O'Dwyer's extradition, which he appealed against.

On 28 November a deal was struck at the High Court in London to avoid him being extradited and led to him signing the three-page deferred prosecution agreement.

The Sheffield Hallam university student could have faced jail if convicted of the allegations, which were brought following a crackdown by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

The agency claimed the TVShack.net website earned more than $230,000 (£147,000) in advertising revenue before US authorities obtained a warrant and seized the domain name in June 2010.

Mr O'Dwyer's extradition application from earlier this year is expected to return to the High Court so it can formally be disposed of. It is expected that he and his family will return to the UK on Friday.

A spokesperson for Mr O'Dwyer said the £20,000 he has been ordered to pay will be used to repay victims whose copyrights were infringed by TVShack.

Mr O'Dwyer will have no criminal record or be subjected to any travel restrictions as a result of the court case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000719-de56aec9c0ce85d9ed235989059db6a4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021010 00000000000 015264  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Kojiki (古事記, "Records of Ancient Matters" or "An Account of Ancient Matters"), also sometimes read as Furukotofumi,[1] is the oldest extant chronicle in Japan, dating from the early 8th century (711–712) and composed by Ō no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei with the purpose of sanctifying the imperial court's claims to supremacy over rival clans.[2][3][4][5] The Kojiki is a collection of myths, early legends, songs, genealogies, oral traditions and semi-historical accounts down to 641[6] concerning the origin of the Japanese archipelago, and the Kami (神). The myths contained in the Kojiki as well as the Nihon Shoki (日本書紀) are part of the inspiration behind many practices. Later, the myths were re-appropriated for Shinto practices such as the misogi purification ritual.[7][8][9][10]

Shinpukuji-bon Kojiki (真福寺本古事記)

Creation [ edit ]

Emperor Tenmu ordered Hieda no Are to memorize stories and texts from history, many of which appear to have been, until the creation of the Kojiki, commonly known oral traditions. Beyond this memorization nothing occurred until after Empress Jitō and Emperor Monmu had both passed and Empress Genmei came to reign. According to the Kojiki, Empress Genmei on the 18th of the 9th month of 711 ordered the courtier Ō no Yasumaro to record what had been learned by Hieda no Are. He finished and presented his work to Empress Genmei on the 28th of the 1st month of 712.[2]

Purpose [ edit ]

As evidenced in the preface of the Kojiki, which states the purpose of its creation as "to erase falsehoods and establish truth", the Kojiki, as well as the Nihon Shoki, were works created with the primary purpose of furthering the imperial agenda. Created not long after the conclusion of the tumultuous Jinshin Rebellion, the Kojiki establishes a pro-Yamato narrative of history which combined with what would become the officially accepted imperial narrative, the Nihon Shoki, would help secure both a historical as well as a divine legitimacy and superiority to a dynasty which would survive up to the atomic era. This historical narrative is clearly broken into the Age of Gods and the Age of Human Emperors, wherein the mythology of the gods which gave birth to the land is told and is transitioned in a chronological fashion to the reign of the emperors, who descend from these same gods. This narrative clearly sets forth the divine mandate by which the Yamato line has right to rule, and through the rhetoric used in the Age of Human Emperors, much of it borrowed from Chinese sources, the historical and military qualifications were likewise established. Several of the narratives which give support to the imperial line, such as the subjugation of certain Korean Empires, have been confirmed as historically false and were included merely to erase failures and bolster reputations of emperors past. Vast amounts of the Age of Human Emperors is spent recounting genealogies, which served not only to give age to the imperial family, which was likely much newer than the Kojiki claims as little evidence has been found to support the existence of early emperors, but also served to tie, whether true or not, many existing clan's genealogies to their own. Regardless of the original intent of the Kojiki, it finalized and possibly even formulated the framework by which Japanese history was examined in terms of the reign of emperors.[2][3]

Structure [ edit ]

The Kojiki contains various songs and poems. While the historical records and myths are written in a form of Chinese with a heavy mixture of Japanese elements, the songs are written with Chinese characters, though only used phonetically. This special use of Chinese characters is called Man'yōgana, a knowledge of which is critical to understanding these songs, which are written in Old Japanese.[11]

Sections [ edit ]

The Kojiki is divided into three parts: the Kamitsumaki (上巻, "first volume"), the Nakatsumaki (中巻, "middle volume") and the Shimotsumaki (下巻, "lower volume").

The Kamitsumaki , also known as the Kamiyo no Maki ( 神代巻 , "Volume of the Age of the Gods") , includes the preface of the Kojiki , and is focused on the deities of creation and the births of various deities of the kamiyo (神代) period, or Age of the Gods. The Kamitsumaki also outlines the myths concerning the foundation of Japan. It describes how Ninigi-no-Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu and great-grandfather of Emperor Jimmu, descended from heaven to Takachihonomine in Kyūshū and became the progenitor of the Japanese imperial line.

The Nakatsumaki begins with the story of Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor, and his conquest of Japan, and ends with the 15th Emperor, Emperor Ōjin. The second through ninth emperors' reigns are recorded in a minimum of detail, with only their names, the names of their various descendants, and the place-names of their palaces and tombs listed, and no mention of their achievements. Many of the stories in this volume are mythological, and the allegedly historical information in them is highly suspect. Recent studies support the view that these emperors were invented to push Jimmu's reign further back to the year 660 BC. [ citation needed ]

The Shimotsumaki covers the 16th to 33rd emperors and, unlike previous volumes, has very limited references to the interactions with deities. These interactions are very prominent in the first and second volumes. Information about the 24th to the 33rd emperors is largely missing, as well.

Study [ edit ]

Kojiki-den by Motoori Norinaga by Motoori Norinaga

In the Edo period, Motoori Norinaga studied the Kojiki intensively. He produced a 44-volume study of the Kojiki called Kojiki-den (古事記伝, "Kojiki commentary").

English-language translations [ edit ]

Manuscripts [ edit ]

There are two major branches of Kojiki manuscripts: Ise and Urabe. The extant Urabe branch consists of 36 existing manuscripts all based on the 1522 copies by Urabe Kanenaga. The Ise branch may be subdivided into the Shinpukuji-bon (真福寺本) manuscript of 1371–1372 and the Dōka-bon (道果本) manuscripts. The Dōka sub-branch consists of:

the Dōka-bon ( 道果本 ) manuscript of 1381; only the first half of the first volume remains

manuscript of 1381; only the first half of the first volume remains the Dōshō-bon ( 道祥本 ) manuscript of 1424; only the first volume remains, and there are many defects

manuscript of 1424; only the first volume remains, and there are many defects the Shun'yu-bon ( 春瑜本 ) manuscript of 1426; one volume

The Shinpukuji-bon manuscript (1371–1372) is the oldest existing manuscript. While divided into the Ise branch, it is actually a mixture of the two branches. The monk Ken'yu based his copy on Ōnakatomi Sadayo's copy. In 1266, Sadayo copied volumes one and three, but did not have access to the second volume. Finally, in 1282, he obtained access to the second volume through a Urabe-branch manuscript that he used to transcribe.

The leaker - whose identity remains a secret - wrote a column for German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung explaining their reasoning and insisting they were not a spy.

In April, the leak of 11.5 million documents from the offices of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca caused a massive worldwide scandal which led to the resignation of the Icelandic Prime Minister.

Allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister David Cameron’s father and several top Fifa executives’ names appeared in the financial documents stretching back 40 years.

The majority of the files document legal activity - but critics have accused worldwide elites of hoarding their wealth in offshore tax havens while ordinary people have been hit by recession, austerity and the increasing cost of living.

The source wrote: “Income inequality is one of the defining issues of our time. It affects all of us, the world over.

“Shell companies are often associated with the crime of tax evasion, but the Panama Papers show beyond a shadow of a doubt that although shell companies are not illegal by definition, they are used to carry out a wide array of serious crimes that go beyond evading taxes.

“I decided to expose Mossack Fonseca because I thought its founders, employees and clients should have to answer for their roles in these crimes, only some of which have come to light thus far. It will take years, possibly decades, for the full extent of the firm’s sordid acts to become known.”

The source criticised the legal profession in particular, saying they helped Mossack Fonseca set up tens of thousands of shell companies in offshore tax havens - more than half of which were based in the British Virgin Islands.

They said their decision to share the files with Suddeutsche Zeitung and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) was “not for any specific political purpose” but because “I understood enough about their contents to realise the scale of the injustices they described”.

The leaker said they did not work for a government or intelligence agency as a member of staff or as a contractor and they never had.

In their 1,800-word manifesto they claimed the Conservative party had been “shameless about concealing their own practices involving offshore companies”.

They called on the European Commission, the British Parliament, the United States Congress, and all nations “to take swift action not only to protect whistleblowers, but to put an end to the global abuse of corporate registers”.

They said they UK Government needed to do more and called for it to introduce public registers of offshore companies which would show who benefits from them.

“The UK still has a vital role to play in ending financial secrecy on various island territories, which are unquestionably the cornerstone of institutional corruption worldwide”, they explained.

The source expressed their admiration for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden - who revealed in 2013 that the US and UK government routinely spy on their own citizens.

Mr Snowden is currently living in Moscow after being charged with espionage by the US.

They said: “For his revelations about the NSA, he [Snowden] deserves a hero’s welcome and a substantial prize, not banishment”.

The source ended their manifesto on a positive note.

They said imbalances of power in the past had “led to revolutions” and “military might was needed to subjugate people” whereas now “curtailing information access is just as effective”.

Despite this: “We live in a time of inexpensive, limitless digital storage and fast internet connections that transcend national boundaries.

“It doesn't take much to connect the dots: from start to finish, inception to global media distribution, the next revolution will be digitised.

“Or perhaps it has already begun”.

Mossack Fonseca has said it was hacked by servers based abroad and has filed a complaint with Panamanian authorities.

It told the BBC the information has been had been misrepresented and it had not acted illegally.

But they rarely get out and walk its shorelines, paddle a boat across its surface or wade into its waters.

Hoping to connect more people to the aquatic landmark that gives the region its name, environmentalists, political leaders and nonprofit groups on Saturday will hold the first-ever “Bay Day,” an all-day event they hope will become an annual tradition.

Roughly 40 events are planned in all nine Bay Area counties at which the public will be encouraged to hike, ride bicycles and kayak on and around the bay, and learn about and celebrate its remarkable features and wildlife.

“The goal is to make this an annual day, like Earth Day for the bay,” said David Lewis, executive director of Save the Bay, an environmental group based in Oakland that is organizing the overall effort.

A full list of the activities — many are free, but some of require registration ahead of time — is at www.bayday.org.

Among them: A cleanup of wetlands and marshes in the Alviso area with volunteer kayakers, guided public bike rides from Berkeley and San Leandro to bayfront trails, volunteer wetland restoration at Bair Island in Redwood City and guided walks along the Sonoma bayfront.

“Everybody is welcome. Bring your helmet; bring your bike,” said Ginger Jui, a spokeswoman for Bike East Bay, a nonprofit group that is hosting two rides to the Alameda County shoreline. “It’s a great time to meet other people who are interested in the bay.”

Apart from recreational activities with family members, organizers hope that if more people experience the bay firsthand, more people will care about it.

“We know that people love the bay, but most of the time they take it for granted,” said Lewis. “The best protection for the bay as it faces new challenges in the coming decades, like sea-level rise and stormwater pollution, is for people to be in touch with it and experience it. We’re hoping this will be an annual opportunity to spread awareness about what the bay needs from people.”

San Francisco Bay is the largest estuary on the West Coast. It drains roughly 40 percent of California’s land and is home to a wide variety of species, from sharks to salmon and bat rays to snowy egrets. But it is also home to 7 million people, eight bridges and numerous factories and wastewater treatment plants that empty into it. Between the 1850s and 1960s, the bay shrunk by one-third due to diking, dredging and filling for farming, airports, highways and development, like Foster City.

Nearly all the filling ended with modern environmental laws, like the Clean Water Act, starting in the 1970s, and in recent years major restoration efforts on thousands of acres have gradually helped bring back wetlands and wildlife. But the bay faces new threats from sea-level rise, diversion of fresh water, plastic pollution, stormwater pollution and invasive species.

Bay advocates won a major victory in June, when Measure AA, a $12 annual parcel tax in all nine Bay Area counties, won voter approval with 70 percent of the vote. That measure will raise $500 million over the next 20 years to restore former industrial salt ponds back to healthy marshes for birds, ducks, harbor seals and other wildlife, along with increasing flood protection for businesses and homes that are threatened as the bay slowly rises from climate change.

“We’ve got much to celebrate with recent success of Measure AA and preserving wetlands from future development, but we have a lot of work still to do,” said San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo.

Liccardo, who broke his foot recently while running and had surgery on Friday, said he’s trying to figure out which events he can join.

“My wife’s trying to get me in a kayak,” he joked. “Assuming I have my doctor’s permission, I hope I’ll be out there with everybody else.”                                                                                                                               0000347-8d7d68298be1af13c80467f53005c8bf.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021720 00000000000 015037  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Abused and disadvantaged mothers and daughters are being honed into a squad of sharpshooters to save wildlife in the Zambezi valley

The black metal of the AR-15 rifle has worn silvery and shiny in parts after years of use. More manageable than an AK-47 in close-quarter combat, the weapon is precise enough to bring down an enemy target at 500 metres. Used for decades by anti-poaching units throughout Africa, today this gun is not carried by a typical swaggering male field ranger; this one is cradled securely and proficiently by Vimbai Kumire. “This job is not meant just for men,” she says, “but for everyone who is fit and strong.”

Kumire is a 32-year-old single mother whose husband ran off with a younger woman while she was pregnant with her second child. She is practising setting up an ambush in the early morning in Zimbabwe’s lower Zambezi Valley, nestling deep into the green undergrowth like a dappled shadow.

This is Africa’s poaching frontline, and these are not just regular female game rangers. If the team behind Kumire’s new job have anything to do with it, these women are a growing squad of environmental shock troops for a new type of community development offensive.

According to conservation biologist Victor Muposhi of Chinhoyi University of Technology, the lower Zambezi Valley has lost 11,000 elephants in the past 10 years. But he believes that hiring and training female rangers such as Kumire directly from the local communities is a game-changer.

“Developing conservation skills in communities creates more than just jobs,” says Professor Muposhi. “It makes local people directly benefit from the preservation of wildlife.” And that, he says, can save not only landmark species such as elephants but entire ecosystems.

This is true empowerment... You are dealing with a highly vulnerable and damaged group of women Victor Muposhi, conservationist

Women’s empowerment is at the core of the programme, named Akashinga, which means the brave ones. “This is a true empowerment programme,” says Muposhi, “because you are dealing with a highly vulnerable and damaged group of young ladies.” Sitting on a rock looking north over one of Africa’s last great wildernesses, Muposhi explains that his early research shows the five-month-old programme is helping change these formerly unemployed single mothers into community leaders.

Primrose Mazliru, 21, stands in the gathering dusk near their camp among the new grass, bright green with the recent rains. Ramrod straight, shoulders back and proud, she smiles despite the vivid scar that runs across her upper lip, where her ex-boyfriend beat her in a drunken rage. “I can testify to the power of this programme to change my life, and now I have the respect of my community, even as a young single mother,” she explains.

Mazliru has already bought a small plot of land with her wages as a field ranger. “I don’t need a man in my life to pay my way for me and my child,” she says, a glint in her eye.

Like most countries in southern Africa, Zimbabwe uses game management areas around famous national parks such as Victoria Falls or Mana Pools as “buffer zones” to protect the animals. These buffer zones are huge tracts of land much larger than the parks themselves, originally created to benefit the surrounding communities by allowing limited trophy hunting by high-dollar foreign clients such as Walter Palmer, the American dentist who attracted worldwide condemnation after killing Cecil the lion on a hunt in 2015.

There are no fences between the hunting areas, or between the wildlife and the estimated 4 million people living on the borders of these protected lands. Some profits from the hunting have gone to support the communities which live in the wilderness areas designated for trophy hunting – almost 20% of Zimbabwe’s land.

According to Muposhi, these precious ecosystems are now under grave threat due to the collapse of commercial hunting, in part because of a growing ethical backlash. “Cecil the lion marked the birth of the greater debate around the issues of morals and ethics in hunting and whether it is sustainable or not.”

Revenues are plummeting and human populations around parks growing. “Five years from now,” says Muposhi, “if we do not have other options, then it will not be viable to save these areas.”

Damien Mander, the founder of the Akashinga initiative, is a tall, Australian, military-trained sniper, who would look very much at home in the centre of a rugby scrum. Mander was inspired by the story of the Black Mambas, the world’s first female, unarmed anti-poaching unit, who work near South Africa’s Kruger National Park. Having met some of the women on a fundraising trip to New York, where they were giving a talk, he saw the international support and interest they received and thought a similar project in Zimbabwe might be a good way to raise the profile of his own project, the International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF). What transpired went way beyond those modest ambitions.

“Thirty-six women started our training, modelled on our special-forces training, and we pushed them hard, much harder than any training we do with men,” he explains from his tented camp at a secret location in the Zambezi Valley. “Only three dropped out. I couldn’t believe it.”

Damien Mander, and all his rangers, live on a vegan diet

From the very first day of the women’s training, he saw that something very special was happening. He realised that women were the missing link to successful conservation and anti-poaching initiatives. “We have turned a security need into a community programme,” he said. In only five months, according to Mander, this pilot project is already putting more money per month into the local community than trophy hunting did per year.

Important people are noticing. Tariro Mnangagwa is a 32-year-old professional photographer who is visiting and training with the International Anti-Poaching Foundation’s Akashinga field ranger unit. She is also the youngest daughter of Zimbabwe’s new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

“These women show me hope,” she says. She heads to a beaten-up Land Rover to visit a community in search of a former poacher who wants to talk.

Annette Hübschle, a senior researcher and post-doctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town, believes that the Akashinga model could still be a great solution. While many western governments and conservation organisations take decisions in London, New York and Geneva, the people most affected are usually women in communities adjacent to protected areas in Africa. Community-driven conservation programmes based around empowerment and training for women such as Kumire and Mazliru offer a potential solution to the end of hunting.

Mander, and all his rangers, live on a vegan diet. His TED talk on veganism has been seen by millions of people around the world. He stopped eating animal products five years ago. “I was wandering around in the bush, protecting one group of animals and coming home and eating another. I could not live with the hypocrisy of that any more.”

The Akashinga have embraced it with gusto. “It’s great,” says Kumire with a huge smile, as she stands in the light of the cooking fire steaming with pots of beans and spinach-like greens. “I don’t miss meat at all, when I go home for leave and people try to feed me meat I can’t eat it because my stomach hurts if I do, and I tell people no, don’t give me meat, I am vegan!” The women around her smile and nod in agreement.

Muposhi, himself a vegan for 13 years, argues that showing communities they don’t need bushmeat is about setting an example, one that stops poaching and reduces the need to farm animals in wilderness areas – a driver of habitat loss. Muposhi is excited to see the project grow. “It is happening right in the middle of nowhere in the Zambezi Valley, and it is part of a greater movement,” he says. “We are going to develop it to become one of the best models of conservation of wildlife based on women’s empowerment.”

As the training exercise unfolds, the female rangers are hidden from sight, the muzzles of their AR-15s poking from tufts of grass. Slowly the two scouts designated as “poachers” walk down the animal track. When they get to the right spot the women explode into action, shouting “Get down! Down! Now, now, now!” Within moments they have the suspects handcuffed. When asked why the pretend “poachers” are shaking, Kumire says that suspects always lay “shaking on the ground”, she laughs. Mander ends the exercise, the women help their friends up with smiles, and together they quietly fall into formation and disappear back into the bush.

The BCS conference commissioners announced Wednesday that Arlington, Texas, edged Tampa, Fla., in the bidding to be the site of the first title game in the new playoff system.

The game will be held Jan. 12, 2015.

The final three sites for the semifinal rotation also were announced and Cowboys Stadium came up a winner again. The Cotton Bowl, which is played at the $1.2 billion home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, will be part of the six-bowl rotation, along with the Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta and the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz. The Holiday Bowl in San Diego also bid for a spot in the semifinal rotation, but couldn’t pull the upset.

The Rose, Orange and Sugar bowls are already part of the semifinal rotation. The Rose and Sugar will host the first semifinals Jan. 1, 2015,

The next season, the Cotton and Orange bowls will host the semifinals on New Year’s Eve. The semis will be played in the Fiesta and Chick-fil-A bowls after the 2016 season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0000768-0b367eb4405f999814075a6384e76f31.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001443 00000000000 014553  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Democrat candidate for president of the United States displayed a disgruntled temperament in a recent video scolding Americans for supporting opponent Donald Trump.

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask?” Clinton says, clearly frustrated. “Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

“If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” an irritated Clinton states. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

Craig Venter, who was one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome and created the first synthetic life form, is up next. And later, we will see two people, paralysed from the waist down, use robotic exoskeletons to rise up and walk.

But first, the co-founder of the Singularity University, Peter Diamandis, gives us our instructions for the day. Your task, he says, is to pick one of the "grand challenges of humanity" – the lack of clean drinking water, say. And then come up with an idea that "can positively impact the lives of a billion people".

It's 9.30 in the morning. Some of us haven't even had coffee yet. There's about 50 of us present and the room has been divided up into tables, one for education, another for poverty, another for water, and I'm not sure where I should sit. Diane Murphy, the university's PR executive, hesitates for a moment and then directs me over to the table marked "food". "Tell you what," she says. "Why don't you take Ashton Kutcher's chair over there. He's not coming until later." (When he does arrive, he pulls up a chair at the next table over. What can I say? If Ashton Kutcher fails to solve global hunger, it will be my fault.)

The Singularity University is really not much like a regular university. And not just because it's a place that manages to accommodate the likes of both Venter and Kutcher (and where, during a Q&A session, somebody asks a question about taking the Singularity University into the ghetto, and it turns out to be from the musician will.i.am).

Its courses aren't accredited, and it has no undergraduates. Stanford University might have been the cradle for a hundred Silicon Valley startups and the hothouse for some of its greatest technical innovations, but the Singularity University is an institution that has been made in the valley's own image: highly networked, fuelled by a cocktail of philanthro-capitalism and endowed with an almost mystical sense of its own destiny.

It is both Silicon Valley's elite future thinktank and its global outreach arm: Google and Microsoft both came to the founding conference and gave money, Nasa provided the campus space, and emblazoned across the website is a quote from Google's co-founder, Larry Page: "If I was a student," he says, "this is where I'd want to be." Its aim is "to assemble, educate and inspire a new generation of leaders who strive to understand and utilise exponentially advancing technologies to address humanity's grand challenges".

So, no pressure then. Although, of course, the easiest thing would simply to be British about all this and scoff. Ashton Kutcher! (I read later that he's been cast to play Steve Jobs in a forthcoming film and slightly suspect that he thinks he might actually be Steve Jobs.) A billion people! It's the kind of thing you can imagine someone in a white coat writing down as evidence just before they decide to commit you. What's more, Diamandis is the kind of can-do entrepreneur that, as a nation, we're inclined to lampoon and shun. (He's good friends with Richard Branson.)

The only problem with this as a strategy is that half the people in the room actually have done things which have had a positive impact on a billion people. Or, in some cases, more. Not just Venter, who has flown in on his private jet; there's also Vint Cerf, who is considered one of the fathers of the internet – he worked on Arpanet, the internet's predecessor – and is now "chief internet evangelist" at Google. And Sebastian Thrun, the man behind one of Google's latest and potentially most disruptive technologies yet, the self-driving car. He's also the head of the top-secret Google X lab, part of the firm that most employees didn't even know existed until the New York Times ran a piece on it last November.

And then, there's Elon Musk, the co-founder of PayPal and Tesla Motors, who created the world's first electric car, and is working on a replacement for the space shuttle. In the audience is Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn. And Troy Carter, Lady Gaga's strategist. Later in the day, Buzz Aldrin shows up. He is, in this company, a genuine celebrity. All the scientists want to have their photo taken with him, and even Kutcher has the good grace to look a bit bashful. "What do you make of the Singularity University?" I ask Aldrin. "I'm a pretty high achiever," he says. "But I come here and think 'Gosh. I've just got to do better.'"

Star factor



Aldrin's lack of achievement notwithstanding – second man to walk on the moon, 66 missions flown in the Korean war, one-time duetter with Snoop Dogg – he has a point. The Singularity University's USP and founding ideology is based on doing better. Its belief in progress is so hard-wired that at times it has a retro-futuristic 1950s flying-cars-and-rocket-packs air about it.

Even the name – the Singularity University – sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel. Largely because its name is something out of a sci-fi novel. "The Singularity" is a term that its co-founder, the writer and futurist Ray Kurzweil, appropriated from an essay by sci-fi writer Vernor Vinge, and although definitions vary, it's usually taken to mean the point at which computer intelligence surpasses human intelligence. Which, according to Kurzweil's predictions, and he does have some form on this, will be in 2029.

Kurzweil is a genuine one-off. He's a scientist, an inventor – he developed one of the first speech recognition systems – an author and a transhumanist: he believes that if he can stay alive long enough for the technology to be invented he'll be able to stay alive for ever. But what he's best known for is being a futurist. He predicted the break-up of the Soviet Union, the growth of the internet, the year in which computers would beat the best human chess players, the e-reader, online education, and dozens more. By his own count 89 of 108 predictions he made in 1999 about where the world would be in 2009 were correct, and another 13 were "essentially correct".

At the heart of all of Kurzweil's predictions is Moore's law. This is the rule that computing power doubles every two years, first noted by Gordon Moore, who went on to co-found Intel, in 1965, and who predicted the trend would continue "for at least 10 years". In fact, it continued for the next five decades, and there's still no end in sight. Computing power shows exponential growth: one becomes two, and two becomes four, and four becomes eight, and when plotted on a chart, it looks like a rocket taking off.

Of course, it's one thing to note this about semiconductors, and another to apply it to all other areas of human life, but if you plotted the career path, business plan, and personal wealth of a significant number of people in the room, there would be an awful lot of rocket-shaped lines. Because Moore's law does seem to describe a lot of what's happened in Silicon Valley. And it's really not that surprising, therefore, that some of its wealthiest and most successful inhabitants have bought into the Singularity University's guiding ethos and spirit.

Vint Cerf tells me that it was Larry Page's enthusiasm and support for the project that encouraged him to get involved "and then I came and discovered that there were these stunningly smart people here, both speaking and in the audience. I find coming here like walking through a forest of ideas."

The standard programme at the Singularity University is a 10-week graduate course which costs $25,000 (£15,500) and last year had 2,400 people applying for 80 slots. It's the Silicon Valley version of an MBA. And demand is such that it has also started doing mini "executive" courses, of the type that I attend. "Billion-dollar companies are springing up overnight," says Peter Diamandis. "And billion-dollar companies are folding overnight." Or as Mike Federle, the chief operating officer of Forbes tells me: "CEOs are desperate to know this stuff. Everyone's trying to figure out what's coming next."

What's more, instead of being held in the Singularity University's campus at Nasa's Ames research centre in northern California, we're in the heart of the Hollywood dream machine, at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. Jim Gianopulos, the chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, went on a Singularity University course, and has since become evangelical about it. Given the traditional antipathy between Hollywood and Silicon Valley (intellectual copyright versus a great big copying machine), this feels like something of a milestone. These ideas are tipping over in the mainstream: Peter Diamandis's book – Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think – went straight into the New York Times bestseller list at No 2 last month and is still lingering in the top 30.

"The power of computers per dollar has increased trillionsfold since I was at college," Kurzweil says in his opening address, speaking as a 3D holographic head projected into the room from his home in Boston. "And war, depression, nothing makes an impact. It keeps on increasing exponentially." Health used to make linear progress, but "it has become an exponential technology". And with 3D printing, so will "the world of physical things".

Our problem with pondering the future is that our expectation is "linear, not exponential," he says. Things aren't going to change incrementally, they're going to change explosively. And it was this that captured Peter Diamandis's attention – he read Kurzweil's book, The Singularity is Near, while trekking in Chile – and inspired him to set up the university.

At the end of the first session of talks, he tells us to "caucus" among ourselves and come up with some solutions for our "grand challenge". And then, oh dear God, "one of you will report back on your findings to the rest of the class".

There's seven of us at our table. And the idea is that between us, we're supposed to come up with a solution – or, let's not be unambitious here, solutions – to feeding the world's seven billion people. What would Ashton say, I wonder? Although my assumption is that it'll be a bit like when Mr Gould, my fourth-form maths teacher, used to try a similar technique back in the 80s, and we'd sit around reading Smash Hits until he wrote the answer on the board.

But no, the group around my table start unembarrassedly throwing around actual ideas: it's possibly why billionaires are billionaires, and chief executives are chief executives. They actually get on and do stuff. "What about artificial meat?" suggests Mike Federle, which in other company might be blue-sky thinking, but here is more factual observation. "We could make a steak right now," says Robert Hariri, a doctor who founded a biotech company that specialises in pioneering stem cell treatments. "But it'll cost you $20,000." I keep my mouth shut and share a sympathetic "we-can't-all-be-geniuses" smile with a nice Latino man across the table. "Ricardo Salinas", says his name tag. The second-richest man in Mexico (and 37th richest in the world), I discover later.

There's a deliberately competitive edge to the proceedings. It plays to the strengths of the chief executives and it's one of Peter Diamandis's guiding principles. He was learning to fly when someone gave him a book about Charles Lindbergh's record-breaking flight across the Atlantic and discovered that it was a journey precipitated by a prize.

It was this theory that led him to set up the X prize, which began with a $10m incentive for the first person or company to create a private reusable manned spacecraft (Burt Rutan and Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, won it in 2004 for their SpaceShipOne). The X prize Foundation has launched many more, the most recent being the $10m Qualcomm Tricorder prize to invent a handheld device – or "tricorder" as it was called in Star Trek – capable of diagnosing 15 diseases.

Abundance of ideas

There's a lot to take in. It's not even lunchtime and we've listened to presentations by Craig Venter on his plans to create biofuels made by microalgae: an acre, he believes, will be able to produce 10,000 litres of oil per year, as opposed to corn, which can produce just 18. He's just received $300m of investment from Exxon to make it a reality.

Andrew Hessel, the Singularity University faculty member on biotech who is attempting to open-source cancer treatments, talks about how biology is the next exponential technology. The genetic code will become "a programming language". We're on the cusp of massive change. DIY bio-hacking has already begun. "Viruses are coming first," he says. "Viruses are easy to make." And then there's Vint Cerf on the "internet of things". In the near future, devices will talk to each other, he says. "You'll be shopping and you'll get a call. It's the refrigerator saying, 'Don't forget the marinara sauce.'"

He ends his talk with his dream of an interplanetary internet. "Darpa [the US defence department's advanced research projects agency] has issued a grant to develop a spacecraft to get to a star in 100 years. At current propulsion rates, that would take 65,000 years, so we'd need a nuclear-powered spacecraft that can travel at two-thirds of the speed of light. But then we have to work out the communication." And he looks slightly regretful. "And we haven't done anything on an intergalactic scale yet."

In this context, it doesn't seem quite as preposterous as it should when somebody suggests using 3D printers (machines that build up objects layer by layer from a digital file) to print 3D printers, which can then print a pair of shoes. Or a house. Or dinner. "Actually, that's already happening," somebody else points out. But then 3D printers – and a prototype house made by extruding liquid concrete from a giant "printer" has indeed already been made – are just one of the Next Big Things coming down the line. We learn about dozens of them in the next two days. This is the "abundance": Diamandis's thesis is that we will soon enter a "post-scarcity" world. Forget peak oil. Who needs it when we have "15 terawatts of power from the sun hitting the earth every 15 minutes"? The challenge is simply harnessing it. "And we're getting better at that all the time."

It's not just that this deters us from changing our own unsustainable behaviour, his critics point out; it's that, as Craig Venter says, this technology is also quite hard. And sometimes doesn't pan out as well as you'd hoped. When he gets up to speak, his microphone doesn't work. "And we're supposed to print out new life forms," he says.

At times, Diamandis comes across as, well, the motivational speaker that he is. He has a line in aphorisms that sound like they have come from an auto-lifecoach-o-generator ("The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself." "If you can't win, change the rules." "Bullshit walks, hardware talks"). Though he has a knack, too, of encapsulating an idea. One of his best-known quotes is that a Masai warrior with a cellphone has better telecommunications capabilities than the president of the United States did 25 years ago. "And if he has a smartphone with Google, he has access to more information than the president did just 15 years ago."

He may be something of a showman, but he's a showman with form. Whom some of the brightest and most successful people in the world take seriously. Last Tuesday, to take just one example, he launched a company – backed by, among others, Larry Page, Google's co-founder, and Eric Schmidt, its chairman – to use spacecraft to mine asteroids for rare minerals.

And he has his friend Richard Branson's knack for marketing. Day two of our three-day course finishes with a party on the set of a New York street in the Fox Studios lot. Two paraplegics rise from their wheelchairs to walk across the stage in powered robotic exoskeletons, and will.i.am gives his thoughts on the day: "It's changed my whole perspective on life. But I'm worried about our inner cities. I've just heard that my niece is going to be dumber than her cellphone. We've had a generation who've wanted to better their bank balances, not their brains. I want to inspire young people to be scientists and engineers."

There's a neat circularity to this. Peter Diamandis grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Greek immigrant parents, and was himself inspired to become a scientist by the Apollo mission, doing degrees in medicine and molecular biology and finally a PhD in aerospace engineering at MIT. The Singularity University isn't even the first university he's founded. He set up the International Space University while he was still in his 20s and which has now trained an entire generation of Nasa scientists. It's why Buzz Aldrin has come along, and why another astronaut, Dan Barry, teaches the SU's robotics course (Barry's big prediction: cyberdildonics. Robot sex. "You think it's funny, right? But I'm also a rehabilitation physician, and sex is a basic human drive robots will be able to fulfil for the disabled, the widowed, the elderly. It's going to happen. You might as well accept it and get in on the ground floor.")

Frightening visions

The future isn't all thrilling robo-sex and free solar energy though. Barry's talk also includes video of some of the other robots in development. If you think drones are scary, it's because you haven't yet seen the video on YouTube of autonomous swarming quadrocoptors. Or the hummingbird-shaped drone that can hover in the air and then fly in through a window, or Big Dog, which looks like something from Blade Runner, or, just last week, a new one with legs that can go where no Dalek ever could: up stairs.

None of these are being developed to help with meals on wheels or palliative care nursing, though. They're war machines, most of which are being developed with funding or support from Darpa. (I meet its head, the formidably impressive Regina Dugan in the ladies: she doesn't seem like a warmonger but then a week later, it's announced that she's leaving to go to Google.)

Even Dan Barry, who runs his own robotics company, sounds a warning: "I don't see any end point here. At some point humans aren't going to be fast enough. So what you do is you make them autonomous. And where does that end? Terminator."

And it's not just the robots. Or the fact that schoolchildren will be tinkering with DNA. "Nobody wants their kid to be the first one off the block to make the Ebola virus," says Venter. "Which is a really small genome." But nor does there seem to be any practical way, that anyone has thought of so far, of preventing it.

It's during the biotech presentation that I hear a British voice pipe up and ask a question about regulation. In the break, I chat to the voice's owner, Simon Levene, a venture capitalist who specialises in technology. He's here, he says, "because there's nowhere else that is this multidisciplinary. This stuff is changing so much and so fast that it's almost impossible to keep abreast of it." He's paid $5,000 for the three days and he reckons it's cheap at the price. "It's a lot less than an MBA, and I've done an MBA at Harvard, and I've probably already learned more here."

The technology is astounding, he says. But, he shares my own qualms about Silicon Valley's techno-utopianism. "There's some potentially lethal side-effects, aren't there? Every solution has unintended consequences. And there are very real ethical and regulatory issues to consider, and which are just being glossed over. The thing is that I don't trust the market to do it. But then I don't trust government either. There needs to be international ethical oversight. There's simply enormous power that's about to be unleashed. Darpa isn't here for fun."

One of the scariest things I hear, though, isn't ostensibly as scary as autonomous death machines. It's when Sebastian Thrun is talking. He unveiled his driverless car at TED in 2011 – developed in response to a competition held by Darpa – after they'd already driven 200,000 miles across California, a technology that will surely change our lives profoundly.

It's been quite a year for Thrun: seeing another presentation at TED by Salman Khan about his online education site, the Khan Academy, Thrun decided to video one of his artificial intelligence classes at Stanford and put it online. An astonishing 160,000 people enrolled, of whom 23,000 graduated. Top of the class was a disabled woman called Melody Bliss, who works full-time, and has kidney dialysis three times a week.

It was enough to persuade Thrun to resign his tenure at Stanford and set up Udacity, a free online university, open to all, that may change the face of education. That's the good news. But he's also founded and is head of Google X, Google's top secret special projects division. It's prototyping "Google glasses", augmented reality spectacles, that will stream the internet direct to your eyeballs. But it's what Thrun says is around the corner that to me seems as if it could be even more life-changing. Massive data. Of everything. "I honestly believe that in the next 10-15 years, computers will be able to capture the experience of a life," he says. Every aspect of your life will exist online forever. And it's not a lonely scientist in a distant computer lab saying this. Thrun, to remind you, works for Google. Memory, the thing that defines who we are, what makes us human, that distinguishes us intellectually, and gives us a narrative sense of our own lives will "be outsourced". That world, says, Thrun, "is not very far away". Enjoy the luxurious privacy of your own memories while you still can.

And then Diamandis asks the scientists there for their best predictions for the next five to 20 years. "AI abilities are going to be indistinguishable from those of human abilities," says Thrun. Most jobs will no longer exist. "There will be an explosion," he predicts, "in art and music." Our definition of what it is to be human is going to change, says Dan Barry. Normal will no longer be enough. Robots are being taught to emote. We are going to start relating to them.

Christopher deCharms, a neuroscientist who has helped develop a new sort of MRI machine that can do brain imaging in real time, goes even further. "I believe that in 10 to 20 to 30 years, truth detectors will work. And they will be retrospective back today. There is going to be a revolution in privacy. Transparency is going to come all the way back to our thoughts."

In his opening address, Ray Kurzweil points out that an IBM computer called Watson, had recently beaten the greatest human champions of the TV quiz game Jeopardy: "And that's not just through statistical analysis. I think it's very significant. It's pattern recognition, which is what people do. It had to understand puns and metaphors and similes and jokes. It can read natural language documents. It read all of Wikipedia. That's 200 million pages of documents. It took three years. But at the end of the three years, there's a natural advantage to machine intelligence."

The singularity really is near, he claims. It's less than 20 years away. "I said it would be 30 years from 1999. The consensus then was 50 years. Today the consensus is about 20 years."

However, when I email Sebastian Thrun and ask his opinion, he says: "It's not a one-time event; it's a continuum that is well under way. It'll be hard to tell how much of it is already happening. In many ways, computers outsmart people today."

He has a point. "Siri [the iPhone voice recognition assistant] reminds me of the woman who's told a dog plays chess and is asked, 'Isn't that amazing?'" says Kurzweil. "And she replies, 'Yes, but its endgame isn't very good.'"

The endgame is likely to get better. And the world is changing. In ways we can't even begin to imagine. And whatever else it's doing, the Singularity University is looking at problems differently. Peter Diamandis never refers to overpopulation or limited resources. He talks about "three billion new minds coming online" in the next few years, Silicon Valley-speak for "being born". These minds are an opportunity, he insists, because "the rate of innovation is a function of the number of people actually communicating and this is growing explosively with the internet".

At lunchtime, I talk to him as he dandles his twin babies on his knees, and is matter-of-fact, rather than techno-triumphalist, about what he's trying to do. He believes people can do extraordinary things. "Because that's my experience: I've seen people do extraordinary things."

And then he asks me a question: "Haven't you? In these last two days?" It's true. I have. There are reasons to be cheerful. Though when it comes to man versus machine, I'd have to say that my money's on the machines.

The record is largely a collaboration between her primary producer/co-songwriter/pal Jack Antonoff of Fun. and Bleachers fame. The songs have, by Lorde’s account, many points of inspiration: from Kate Bush (at one point in the article, Antonoff encourages Lorde to “do it weird and Kate Bushy”) to Robyn (whose image Antonoff and Lorde placed on the upright piano when they performed on SNL last month) to just whatever she was listening to on Top 40 radio at the time.

Antonoff and Lorde mostly tried to keep to themselves, but they apparently workshopped Melodrama’s first single, “Green Light,” with veteran pop mastermind Max Martin, responsible for hits from Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone” to Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off.”

Martin did not think the song was a hit. According to Lorde, he called it “incorrect songwriting” and objected to the marked key change that occurs when the heavy piano part kicks in on the pre-chorus (in Top 40 hits these days, key changes are either reserved for amplified final choruses–see Lady Gaga’s “Perfect Illusion”–or, much more often, occur not at all), as well as some other structural details.

Here’s the relevant passage from the Times profile:

When Max Martin heard “Green Light” shortly before its release, she told me, “he had a very specific opinion, which had to do with the melodic math — shortening a part” … Martin described “Green Light” as a case of “incorrect songwriting,” Lorde said, clarifying that this “wasn’t an insult, just a statement of fact,” and one, furthermore, that she agreed with: “It’s a strange piece of music.” (The press-averse Martin declined to comment.) On top of the left-field key change, “the drums don’t show up on the chorus until halfway through, which creates this other, bizarre part.”

The commentary seems to fit easily with Martin’s philosophy of songwriting, as explicated in a rare, recently-unearthed interview with the producer in a Swedish magazine. “There shouldn’t be too much information in the overall sound,” Martin explained. “I work a lot on getting it all as clear and distinct as possible. There should never be too many new elements introduced at the same time. One at a time. Like in a movie. You can’t introduce ten characters in the first scene. You want to get to know one before you’re ready for the next.”

But Lorde still ended up making the song as she wanted to make it, though its collage-like structure may have contributed to its slightly disappointing chart performance. (It peaked at #19, and has fallen since.) “‘When it comes to ‘melodic math,” Lorde told the Times Magazine, ‘I have a strong awareness of the rules — 60 percent of the time I follow them; 40 percent, I don’t.'” And in Martin’s interview, he too acknowledged that trends and formulas change. One quote makes one think of Melodrama’s second single “Liability”: “A hit can be someone just singing to piano music, anything.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000745-1f796e5f6f850736ded939c84bd76654.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006732 00000000000 015023  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared victory after voters approved by a slim majority constitutional changes that would introduce a presidential system in the country, despite its three largest cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, narrowly voting against the proposal.

The Yes campaign won 51.3 per cent of the vote, according to Turkey’s state news agency.

Sadi Guven, the head of Turkey’s high electoral board, confirmed the passage of the referendum on Sunday night, based on unofficial results.

The result puts Mr Erdogan in pole position to assume political control of the country. He has occupied the presidency, a largely ceremonial role in Turkish politics, since his election to the post in August 2014.

However, on Sunday evening the opposition Republican People’s Party rejected claims that the Yes side had secured an undisputed victory, claiming that, among other issues, the Supreme Election Commission should not have accepted ballots without official stamps.

Although previous elections and referendums saw independent and opposition media outlets report the results from across the country, Sunday’s count was reported and broadcast by the state Anadolu news agency.

Several incidents occurred during polling, with at least three people killed at a polling booth outside the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. Anadolu Agency reported an attack on an AK Party bus in the eastern province of Van late on Saturday night that killed the nephew of a local politician.

Voting in Turkey’s major cities largely passed off without incident. In the Kadiköy district on the Asian side of Istanbul, a predominantly secular area that saw an energetic campaign against the constitutional changes over the past two weeks, voting at the girls’ technical school was steady throughout this morning and a police car was stationed outside throughout the day.

In the Moda neighbourhood, Easter Mass-goers and elderly voters crowded at streets and cafes.

‘No’ majorities

“Yes, I voted and of course [I voted] No because Erdogan wants to be a dictator and he is not a democrat,” said Sinan Beritan Mehmetoglu, whose mother, Sengul, the head of a social democratic Kurdish party in the eastern city of Kars, was detained by the authorities in December.

“I don’t want one person to be in charge of Turkey . . . Democracy will come without Erdogan,” said Mr Mehmetoglu, who this weekend undertook a 870km round trip from university to his home town to cast his vote.

The Yes’ campaign prevailed across the so-called “Anatolian tiger” provinces of central Turkey, long-standing centres of power for the ruling AK Party that have been transformed by investment over the past decade.

Traditional AK Party supporters were helped over the line by backing from the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party, Turkey’s smallest parliamentary party. Overseas votes from Germany and the Netherlands, countries that were involved in a series of diplomatic spats with Ankara in recent weeks, also appear to have proved crucial to the Yes campaign.

Erdogan’s vote

The Yes campaign dominated Turkey’s airwaves throughout the campaign as many of the country’s independent media outlets had been shut down over the past 12 months following a crackdown against outlets allegedly linked to Kurdish and opposition organisations.

Although voting in elections and referendums is compulsory in Turkey, Sunday’s turnout of more than 85 per cent of the 55 million Turks eligible to vote was considered high.                                      0000785-959d80558633c5ea7762d534b64dd7ca.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001644 00000000000 014777  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The MyPod™ let's you connect with friends The MyPod™ is perfect for sports parents who want to stay 'connected' at the game.

The US and Mexico have reached a proposed deal to open US highways to Mexican trucks, raising hopes of an end to a 20-year dispute.

US President Barack Obama said the nations had "found a clear path to resolving" the roadblock in relations.

In a news conference with Mexico's Felipe Calderon, Mr Obama pledged to speed aid to Mexico's anti-drug effort.

The Mexican president's two-day visit to Washington comes amid increasing tensions between the two nations.

The announcement of the trucking deal comes roughly two weeks after the killing of a US agent in Mexico and leaked US criticism of Mexico's war on drugs, both of which have soured a relationship between the nations that had appeared to be improving in recent years.

Retaliation

US and Mexican carriers were authorised to cross the border under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, but the US has refused to allow Mexican trucks access over concerns of their ability to meet US safety and environmental standards.

Mexico has a full partner with the United States. Our people have a right to be safe in their communities US President Barack Obama

American truckers have opposed opening US roads to Mexican truckers, arguing the move would cost US lorry drivers' jobs.

Mr Calderon's government last year retaliated with tariffs on a number of US goods after US lawmakers cancelled funding for a pilot programme that allowed long-haul Mexican trucks to circulate in the US.

Teams are still working out the details of the agreement and are expected to send the plan to Congress this spring, an Obama administration official told the Associated Press news agency.

"I look forward to consulting with Congress and moving forward in a way that strengthens the safety of cross-border trucking, lifts tariffs on billions of dollars of US goods, expands our exports to Mexico, and creates jobs on both sides of the border," Mr Obama said.

Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said the trucking deal would promote job growth on both sides of the border, and called for an end to Mexico's tariffs.

'Extraordinary courage'

Mr Obama also announced the US would soon look to "develop new sources of energy in the Gulf of Mexico" with the help of the Mexican government.

And he went on to praise Mr Calderon for his "extraordinary courage" in fighting drug cartels and cracking down on violence near their shared border.

Mr Obama said the US planned to send equipment to Mexico and train officials in the country to help in the efforts to combat violence.

He also said the US had to curb the flow of powerful weapons - which are easily acquired in US border states - to Mexico to arm the drug cartels.

"Mexico has a full partner with the United States," Mr Obama said, adding that US citizens had a "right to be safe in their communities".

Mr Calderon met US business leaders on Wednesday evening, with discussions focusing on opportunities for foreign investment in Mexico.

Agent's death

Tensions between the countries have risen sharply since US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata was shot dead in northern Mexico roughly two weeks ago, reportedly with a weapon that came from the US.

"His death must urge us to work together to ensure a prosperous and peaceful future for our region," Mr Calderon said on Thursday.

On Sunday, the Mexican military arrested the suspected local head of Los Zetas drugs gang in the northern state of Coahuila.

Another alleged member of the gang has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out the killing.

US and Mexican officials said Mr Calderon's trip had been arranged before Mr Zapata's death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0000558-69f73edac27b53588db20b83c5ff1449.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002105 00000000000 015121  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Blizzard is considering adding in-game micro-transactions to massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft.

Community manager Zarhym confirmed the news on Battle.net after players noticed the Enduring Elixir of Wisdom item on the Public Test Realm.

According to its description, this "in-game store" item increases experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests by 100 per cent.

The Enduring Elixir of Wisdom sparked a debate within the World of Warcraft community, with some expressing concern that the addition of micro-transactions would give those willing to pay an advantage over those who are not.

"We are currently exploring the possibility of adding a way for players in certain regions to make purchases directly within the game," Zarhym said. "As part of this process, elements related to this will be appearing on the PTR. We'll provide additional updates on our plans as development progresses."

Blizzard is yet to confirm which regions may be in-line for in-game micro-transactions, so the potential feature may never arrive on these shores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000829-c1c2c16fe48f17d8b0f81042e981c9e2.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021762 00000000000 015122  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Kid Cudi's currently invading cities across the country as part of his "Cud Life Tour." Besides the music, the talk of the show has been Cudi's next-level spacesuit he's currently wearing on stage. Cudi swapped out the usual vintage t-shirt and jean uniform for the astronaut-esque suit that was designed by noted Hollywood costume designer Jose Hernandez.

Officially dubbed the "Satellite Academy Space Suit" Cudi will wear the otherworldy duds on every stop of the "Cud Life Tour." As he explains, it's more than just an interesting clothing choice; the suit represents a transition in his mind-state back to the highly anticipated Man On The Moon III album that's coming in 2015. While Cudi was traveling to Vancouver, he spoke to us about the details of the suit, and what we can expect from the final chapter of the "Man on the Moon" trilogy.

Interview by Joe La Puma (@jlapuma)

I thought it would be cool to give people some type of Moon Man visual, which I’ve never done before.

What made you decide that this tour was the right time to have a customized spacesuit?

Well, when I look back at the Indicud album coming out, I realize that it was a big transition for me as an artist. I wanted to absorb the music and take my live show to the next level.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

With that train of thought, I took a step back and started to think about ways I could bring an experience to the kids at the show. Leading up to the storyline of Man on the Moon III, I feel like everything that’s happening up to now is the prelude. With the way Indicud left off, it was like I went back to the moon to gain some peace of mind. I jumped back in my ship and left Earth after I was resurrected from the death of Mr. Rager in Man on the Moon II.

So this is part of the warm-up for Man on the Moon III.

This is me thinking about the trilogy and the theme of the story to show what Man on the Moon III is going to be, subject-matter wise. I thought it would be cool to give people some type of Moon Man visual, which I’ve never done before. It’s always been metaphorical, but coming up with the suit idea just hit me.

How did the process of the suit being made start?

I reached out to my boy Omarr Rambert who works with Jaden Smith after I saw the After Earth suit in the preview. I was watching the trailer, and I thought, "Man, that suit is fresh. It’d be dope if I had something like that on the road." Then I just started wondering if it would be possible.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

Omar made some calls and got me in touch with José Hernandez, who created the suit for After Earth and many other films. He’s been a part of so many things, whether it’s X-Men, Spider-Man, or Tron. The dude’s work is remarkable and he pays close attention to detail. He’s a genius. Linking up with him was awesome because he understood my vision. We went back and forth a couple times on the designs, but once we had it, we had it. Then everything came together.

What are some special features that, to the untrained eye, people may not catch?

Well, the first special feature is that there’s a zip-hole for me to take a bathroom break—not kidding—that no one knows about. There’s that. Also, it’s really comfortable. We did a full-body scan so that it would be totally designed for my body, and it fits really well. It’s actually a bit of a workout on stage, and it feels awesome to be performing in it and sweating.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

Outside of that, the detail on the backpack is something that we paid close attention to, because we wanted to have my ears hidden. José got the measurements and created the little hidden space in the book bag with wires so the antenna can come out, and I can adjust the volume on the pack as well. So that’s a dope little custom feature, as opposed to back in the day, where I had to reach behind on my back pocket and turn up the volume. Now the pack is hidden, and it’s not such an eyesore.

What other aesthetic details were the focus?

With the logo on the chest, I was like, "I really want to have an emblem, but I don’t want it to be super fuckin’ cheesy." I just wanted to have my logo, and I designed the whole gold crest that it’s in. When he showed it to me, I was like, "Holy shit, that’s exactly what I’m looking for."

José said, "Do you want to have lights on the shoes?" And I said, "I don’t want to take the lighting to the extreme." We even got to a point where we were talking about a helmet at first, but I think that the suit and the emblem on the chest are enough flair. It’s already intense that I’m wearing this suit. We didn’t wanna OD on it and cross that line between creative and cheesy because it’s a thin line.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

It's still a far departure from most on-stage ensembles.

Let’s be real, I’m ultimately performing in tights. I’m always thinking about the best way to execute things with taste. It’s still flashy and dope. People aren’t going to look at it and be like, "What the fuck is this dude doing?" Even the people who are looking at it that way, whatever. I’m wearing a fucking awesome ass, custom-made space suit designed by the hottest costume designer in Hollywood. Shit is a dream come true.

You’re known as a fashion-forward artist, obviously. But is this going to be the outfit on every single stop of the tour?

Yeah, except for Rock the Bells.

It’s time to take them to the moon again.

OK. Then the Saint-Laurents come out, right?

Yeah, the Saint-Laurents. We really planned ahead as far as how many suits we needed. And we got four suits made—full suits, boots, everything.

That’s crazy. I thought it was only one.

Oh no, we got multiples. We did this shit right. I paid for it out of my own pocket, too.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

Was the price absolutely absurd?

I mean, let’s put it this way: I think I could have got myself another Mercedes SLS.

Wow.

[Laughs]. I’ll take the space suit.

How long does it take to get in the suit?

It usually takes about 15 minutes. It takes three people to help me get in and three people to help me get out.

I like that the suit represents more of a mind-state for you. It’s not a costume, it’s gearing up for The Man on the Moon III and getting ready for 2015.

Yeah, exactly. It’s like when Kal-El found his Superman suit and put that bitch on, and he said he could be a hero. I don’t think I’ve ever been more ready to put on that suit, go out there, give these kids a show, talk to them, and be their guide. It takes a level of maturity.

It took me a while to finally get to this point. I’m totally comfortable with who I am, the discography I’ve created, the stories I’ve told, and the fanbase that I have. As I look at shit in retrospect, I’m really blessed. I’m still here doing my thing, and I can draw crowds and sell out concerts. I’d like to see a lot of these guys that are hot now doing this shit five years from now. It’s not easy.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

It's safe to say you're in a good headspace on this tour?

Nothing’s promised, and I just feel really fucking happy and lucky that I have a strong fan base that believes in me and everything that I want to do creatively. To be able to create without boundaries, whether it’s the music, creating my crazy-looking stage, or wearing a spacesuit, it’s awesome that I have so many people who are onboard with whatever I want to be. So, it’s dope, man.

I have to ask about the music for Man On The Moon III. You said you haven't recorded anything yet, but is there anything fans can expect?

It definitely represents the full cycle of the trilogy—becoming a man. When people hear Man on the Moon III, they’ll see. There’s a crazy twist to the whole tale. There are things that we were missing, that I was missing, and that the kids were missing this whole time. A lot of things will be revealed in Man on the Moon III, a lot of like, "Ahhh, OK. Man, we had it wrong. We went about it the wrong way." It’s gonna be a dope conclusion, and I’m really excited about it.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

I was more nervous with Man on the Moon II because I feel like there will be no Man on the Moon III if Man on the Moon II wasn’t what it was. And yeah, I’m really excited, man. The albums in between were great segues. It’s time to take them to the moon again.

Have you sat down with Plain Pat and Emile?

I hung out with Pat. He came to LA, and we talked and shit. I played him some beats. We vibed out. We definitely started talking about how to approach Man on the Moon III. Emile, I haven’t spoken with. I’m pretty sure he’s busy, handling his business. He’s constantly creating. Man on the Moon III is way off. We got time. So when Emile is ready, and when Pat has time, we’re definitely gonna get in there and create this fucking classic.

The rock formation is spread out in a sort of egg-shaped pattern or ovoid about 50 meters (164 feet) in diameter with its major axis aligning in a This image is from a paper published in an academic journal as well as a research blog by the authors of the paper. The diagram is an image from a survey of the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement in Victoria, Australia showing the proposed solar alignments. Ray P. Norris Custodian Reg Abrahams told Abrahams points out that the rock formation also depicts the landscape in art form. “There are a few mountain ranges around the site, and if you get in certain positions within the stone arrangement you’ll see three big mountains and the three large rocks which mimic them." The Wurdi Youang site was once owned by a farmer who fenced the site to protect it from being destroyed. In 2006, title to the land was turned over to the Wathaurong Aboriginal Cooperative, the traditional owners. Now, the cooperative and community elders are working with researchers at the site and its exact location is being kept under wraps. So far, says Abrahams, scientists have found evidence of semi-permanent villages and evidence of early fishing and farming practices. There are areas where eel traps would have been set up and even signs of "gilgies", or terraces used in farming. "You see a lot of agricultural and aquacultural practices, so evidence of this agriculture may go back tens of thousands of years, pre-dating what anthropologists commonly think of as the dawn of agriculture which is about 11,000 years ago in Mesopotamia," he said, according to The Australian Aboriginal constellation of "Tchingal," the "Emu in the Sky", which stretches from the Coalsack at its head, to Scorpius to the left. en:User:Rayd8 Dr. Duane Hamacher is a leader in the study of Indigenous astronomy, and he has been working closely with the Aboriginal elders at the site to reconstruct some of the astronomical knowledge that has been lost since white Australians came to the continent. Dr. Hamacher says that the early first Australians had Abrahams and Hamacher both are excited over the prospect of Murdi Youang being older than Stonehenge. "Some academics have referred to this stone arrangement here as Australia's version of Stonehenge," Dr. Hamacher said. He added, "I think the question we might have to ask is: is Stonehenge Britain's version of Wurdi Youang? Because this could be much, much older." If indeed, Murdi Youang is much older than Stonehenge, it would rewrite the history of the Aboriginal people of Australia, and make historians rethink the notion that early Australians were nothing more than nomadic hunter-gatherers, "We know agriculture started around 12,000 years ago, and if this site dates back to around then, perhaps Aboriginal people were some of the first, says Dr. Hamacher. The Wurdi Youang stone arrangement, located at Mount Rothwell near Little River, Victoria is an historic Aboriginal site that consists of about 100 basalt rocks, ranging from small rocks about 20 cm (7.8 inches) in diameter to standing stones about 1m (3.2 feet) high.The rock formation is spread out in a sort of egg-shaped pattern or ovoid about 50 meters (164 feet) in diameter with its major axis aligning in a due east-west direction . Of particular interest is the three prominent waist-high stones that stand at the highest point on the western end of the arrangement of rocks.Custodian Reg Abrahams told the Guardian the stones clearly identify the equinox, the winter solstice, and the summer solstice. As an astronomical observatory, the position of the stars in the night sky was important to Aboriginal ceremonies, songs, navigation, and time-keeping.Abrahams points out that the rock formation also depicts the landscape in art form. “There are a few mountain ranges around the site, and if you get in certain positions within the stone arrangement you’ll see three big mountains and the three large rocks which mimic them."The Wurdi Youang site was once owned by a farmer who fenced the site to protect it from being destroyed.

There are areas where eel traps would have been set up and even signs of "gilgies", or terraces used in farming."You see a lot of agricultural and aquacultural practices, so evidence of this agriculture may go back tens of thousands of years, pre-dating what anthropologists commonly think of as the dawn of agriculture which is about 11,000 years ago in Mesopotamia," he said, according to Australia ABC Dr. Duane Hamacher is a leader in the study of Indigenous astronomy, and he has been working closely with the Aboriginal elders at the site to reconstruct some of the astronomical knowledge that has been lost since white Australians came to the continent.Dr. Hamacher says that the early first Australians had complex knowledge systems , especially where the stars, planets and seasons began and ended. With white colonialism, much of the traditional knowledge was erased, so he is working with the Aboriginal community to bring that knowledge back.Abrahams and Hamacher both are excited over the prospect of Murdi Youang being older than Stonehenge. "Some academics have referred to this stone arrangement here as Australia's version of Stonehenge," Dr. Hamacher said. He added, "I think the question we might have to ask is: is Stonehenge Britain's version of Wurdi Youang? Because this could be much, much older."If indeed, Murdi Youang is much older than Stonehenge, it would rewrite the history of the Aboriginal people of Australia, and make historians rethink the notion that early Australians were nothing more than nomadic hunter-gatherers,"We know agriculture started around 12,000 years ago, and if this site dates back to around then, perhaps Aboriginal people were some of the first, says Dr. Hamacher.

According to data from Box Office Mojo, the Zac Efron DJ movie officially clocks in as the third worst wide-release debut ever, just behind Delgo and Oogieloves In The BIG Balloon Adventure. (Box Office Mojo’s data only goes back to 1982, and we excluded rereleases. We also only included films that opened in more than 2,000 theaters.)

The official list of the worst wide openings is an eclectic mix of animated movies, comedies, and thrillers, and it includes everything from All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 to The Adventures of Pluto Nash. We Are Your Friends marks Wes Bentley’s second appearance on the list, as he also starred in the trapped-in-a-parking-garage horror flick P2.

The catch-all term for urbane, non-conformist city dwellers gets thrown around a lot, yet people seem reluctant to identify themselves by that mantle. Defining the word is a different matter.

“You can spot a hipster from a mile away,” said Kayla Rocca, listing the telltale signs from her bench in Trinity Bellwoods Park: tattoos, cut-off shirts, skinny jeans, vintage apparel, beards, bicycles, thick-rimmed glasses (prescription optional) and an affinity for obscure music and independent movies. “They strive to be different, and yet they’re a cohesive group,” added Rocca’s friend, Angie Ruffilli. “And they’re never athletic,” she laughed. So where does this metropolitan character dwell in Toronto, this city of many neighbourhoods? Is it more hip to sip Americanos in Little Italy than to down pints at a Parkdale pub? Do the cool kids hang loose in the Junction, or do they haunt Ossington Ave.?

There may now be an answer. Last week, restaurant and bar review site Yelp unveiled a new “wordmap” function, where a selection of keywords culled from more than 39 million user-submitted reviews in the first quarter of the year were used to plot hot spots for certain terminology. The tool was introduced for major cities such as New York, London, Paris and Toronto, where Yelp charted areas where words like “hipster,” “romantic” and “tourist” were most commonly used in reviews. In Toronto’s case, the “hipster” heat map shows a deep red swath over Kensington Market, while the thickest concentration of perceived hipsterism runs along Queen St. W., from about Spadina Ave. to Dufferin St., and up Ossington Ave. to Dundas St. Yet even in the apparent hipster heartlands, it’s difficult to find someone who wears the term as a badge of honour. “I don’t know anybody who self-identifies as hipster,” said Kay Jorgensen, 23, who works reception at a west-end ad agency. “It’s a label that’s put onto others.”

Paul Mullins, an anthropologist at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, said this reluctance to self-identify is what makes the hipster subculture different than other more iconoclastic movements, like goths or punks. “It has become a nasty, castaway word,” said Mullins, arguing the use of the word is often derogatory, meant as a put-down for people perceived to possess a self-styled “authentic” look that isn’t all too original — they’re seen as anticonformist conformists, essentially. “It’s consumer politics,” Mullins said.

He added that the term dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, when it was connected with a rejection of the “white” values of mainstream America, such as suburban living and the nuclear family. It made a resurgence in the late 1990s, and has since been associated with a sort of early-adopter, “hipper than thou” sense of superiority. Hipsters are the first ones in on the new bands, for instance. “Hipster, in its revival, referred to an air of knowing about exclusive things before anyone else,” wrote journalist Mark Greif in a 2010 feature on the movement for New York Magazine. Chris Loane, a manager at the Drake Hotel, which sits smack dab in the hotbed of hipsterism outlined in the Yelp map, said the establishment takes a balanced approach to the idea of hipsterism. The aim is to position oneself as a harbinger of cool without alienating potential customers — to be hipster in vibe, if not in name, Loane said. “We want to be on that curve, or on that crest, without being arrogant about it,” he said. “We tend to stay away from that term.” They’re not alone.                                                                                                                                                           0000775-70bf63df7c009b45c8440880d1914b1a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004600 00000000000 014737  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        ISLAMABAD: The Pakistani rupee tumbled on Friday after what appeared to be an effective devaluation by the central bank, which later said a weaker local currency would help the economy grow and contain the balance of payments pressures.

In a volatile trading session, the rupee slumped to 109.50 per dollar at one point after opening at 105.55.

It closed at 107 per dollar, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), after having mostly traded in a tight range of 104-105 per dollar since December 2015.

Traders and analysts said the fall was a de facto devaluation by the central bank, which is the biggest player in the thinly-traded rupee market and controls what is widely understood to be a managed float system.

“Everybody saw it coming. It has not come as a surprise,” said Saad Hashmey, research director at brokerage Topline Securities.

The SBP had previously attempted to devalue in July but the move was reversed by the then-finance minister Ishaq Dar — who claimed he was unaware of the central bank’s plan and ordered an investigation.

Fawad Khan — the head of research at BMA Capital — said the central bank had “withdrawn” its support for the rupee. Other analysts also interpreted the plunge as a devaluation.

In a statement after the closing bell, the SBP said the rupee had slumped due to “pressures” from high growth in imports and depletion of Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves.

“SBP is of the view that this market-driven adjustment in the exchange rate will contain the imbalance in the external account and sustain higher growth trajectory,” it said.

The central bank added that it “stands ready to intervene, in case speculative and/or momentary pressures emerge, for [the] smooth functioning of the foreign exchange markets”.

Hashmey said market participants will watch in the next few sessions to see where the rupee settles.

“Given how the episode in July ended, I think the markets may just wait and see,” he added.

A growing number of economists had been urging the central bank to devalue what they said was an artificially strong rupee, arguing that its strength was hurting the manufacturing sector.

The balance of payments pressure is largely due to imports of machinery and other Chinese goods connected with a $57 billion infrastructure investment by China, part of its planned Belt and Road trade route stretching to Asia, Europe, and beyond.                                                                                                                                0000857-27f115db6ee984de3188e5058f447841.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007721 00000000000 014724  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Here’s the standard story about the U.S. power grid: It gets baseload supply from hydro, nuclear, and coal (in that order), using natural gas (and the occasional oil plant) as a swing producer to meet peak demands. Renewables play on the margin, but are neither big nor reliable enough to matter from a grid planning perspective.

On average, that story is true. In recent years, however, a steadily larger portion of total U.S. power supply comes from sources that we historically think of as “intermittent” — namely, natural gas and renewables. Is that the beginning of a new paradigm (the dream of both the renewable and natural gas communities) or an unsustainable deviation from the average (the dream of the coal industry)? To answer that question, we must review a bit of history.

The chart below shows the percent of total U.S. power that came from the “baseload triumvirate” of coal, nuclear, and hydro (C-N-H) from 1949-2010, plus the percentages that came from natural gas, oil, and other renewables over the same period.

Several observations, working backward in time:

First, notice that since 1985, we’ve fallen from relying on C-N-H for 85 percent of our electricity to just 70 percent. That’s a direct result of the fact that nuclear and coal power plants are cost-prohibitive to build in a post-Clean Air Act, post-Seabrook world. And so we haven’t built any — we’ve just maxed out the ones we already have. This, in a nutshell, is why the coal industry is so grumpy lately.

Second, virtually all of the recent fall-off in C-N-H production has been matched by an increase in natural gas-fired power. Gas, not wind, has been the biggest beneficiary. However, it’s worth noting that the growth in gas generation has been the result of lots and lots of new natural gas power plants getting built. The natural gas fleet has gotten much bigger, but in terms of capacity factor — that is, the number of MWh the fleet generates in a given year relative to its theoretical maximum — the fleet struggles to stay above 25 percent, which interestingly enough is about the same as the wind fleet:

Now compare the 20-year period from 1990-2010 with the 20 year period from 1950-1970. They look remarkably similar, with C-N-H falling from ~80 to 70 percent and natural gas rising from ~10-20 percent. Indeed, the only significant distinction between the two eras is in oil-fired generation, within which there are lessons for the current gas boom.

1950-1970 was the era of cheap oil. OPEC price shocks hadn’t happened yet and — hard as it is to imagine today — many utilities were actively converting their coal plants to oil in the name of cost conservation. (See, for example, here, or this history of National Grid.) Needless to say, that turned out to be a bad idea when oil prices spiked in the ’70s. Lots of oil plants were converted back to coal and, luckily for electric costs, lots of nuclear plants were coming online. Nuclear didn’t yet have its (soon to come) history of cost overruns to prevent regulators from approving further investments. The result was a fairly rapid transition away from oil and gas, increasing our dependency on C-N-H.

Now, fast-forward to the present. Much like in the 1960s, we’re becoming ever less dependent on C-N-H and ever more dependent on natural gas to meet our electricity demands. Where we once believed that oil would forever be cheap, we now believe that natural gas will forever be cheap. That seems unlikely.

Perhaps the biggest difference between the two eras is that, while the 1960s saw a steady addition to the U.S. baseload C-N-H fleet, our recent additions have been only to historically non-baseload sources:

As a result, when economics drove us away from oil in the 1970s, we had the option to fall back on lower (marginal) cost power generation sources. If history repeats itself, we won’t have that luxury this time. In other words, don’t get complacent about the recent downturn in natural gas and electric prices. It can’t last.                                               0000755-92c9737e7f12962e1fe348d3b5e0126f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010267 00000000000 014771  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The center of student life at NYU is a striking building called the Kimmel Center on Washington Square. Martin and Helen Kimmel have given NYU millions. The Kimmels also give tons of money to the Metropolitan Opera, the Museum of African Art, Habitat for Humanity, the Center for Reproductive Rights, Sidwell Friends School, and Human Rights Watch too.

Yesterday the Washington Post said that 81 congresspeople are going to Israel this summer “courtesy of the AIPAC lobby”– as if we have the bad old right-wing Israel lobby to blame.

But that’s a delusion. It’s people like the Kimmels, the heart and soul of the liberal Jewish establishment. The Kimmels give bigtime to the American Israel Education Foundation, the AIPAC spinoff that funds charities and pays for congresspeople to travel to Israel. The Kimmels gave $3.5 million to the American Israel Education Foundation, or AIEF, over several recent years, according to the Form 990s that their family foundation has provided to the government.

Indeed, my search of 990s shows that the AIEF is getting tons of money from the same people who fund good liberal institutions. I’ve looked at about a third of more than 300 federal filings of charitable contributions to the AIEF in recent years; and the pattern is clear–many people who give to liberal causes like abortion right also pay for Israel junkets.

The Abby and Mitch Leigh Foundation gave the Abby and Mitch Leigh Hall to Yale University’s music school. It also gives generously to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which took on the Bush Administration on abortion policy. Well, the Leigh Foundation has given $35,000 to send your congressperson to Israel.

Or the Wilf Foundation. It gave Princeton University a lovely new brick dormitory called Wilf Hall, which is under construction. And meantime the Wilfs have given $150,000 to the AIEF, according to government filings.

Consider the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation– the Fishers love the arts. They give money to the Actor’s Fund, the Roundabout Theater and the Manhattan Theatre Club, where young friends of mine have done workshop productions. But they also gave $175,000 to the American Israel Education Foundation, which is paying for congresspeople to learn how great Israel is.

Or Margaret and Richard Lipmanson Foundation. It gave the liberal group the ACLU $10,000 one year– and the American Israel Education Foundation $30,000.

Or the Long-Island-based Susan and Leonard Feinstein Foundation. It helps liberal causes, education and the arts– Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the American Ballet Theater, Nassau Coalition Against Domestic Violence, NYU School of Medicine. But the Feinstein Foundation gave $450,000 to the American Israel Education Foundation over eight years.

Yes, the American Israel Education Foundation gets hundreds of thousands, millions even, from rightwingers. Sheldon Adelson gives it money, for instance. There are many obviously-conservative Jewish-oriented foundations in the lists of AIEF givers. Susan Wexner’s foundation funds AIEF and also the David Project and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

And Haim Saban, the “ardent Zionist” toymaker, gave $8 million to the American Israel Education Foundation over two years and more than $6 million to the Friends of the IDF (Israeli army).

Saban was also giving millions to Bill Clinton’s Presidential Foundation and the Brookings Institution.

And that’s the point. When you comb through the lists of people who are paying for 1 out of 5 Congresspeople to spend their recess in Israel this summer, many of them are the heart and soul of the liberal Jewish establishment. And apart from the political corruption question– why is a Congresswoman in Israel not her home district this August as the economy disintegrates?– these donor lists speak to a larger cultural issue: the inability of the liberal establishment to address the Israel/Palestine issue in a liberal fashion.

When Princeton, and Yale, and NYU, and Human Rights Watch, and the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the American Ballet Theater, and the Manhattan Theatre Club and the ACLU are getting huge gifts from these foundations, do you think they don’t know which side their bread is buttered on?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0000870-0c7e7bafc6a5ac46a12c9c5ae6bf992a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014550 00000000000 015463  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The mysterious sinkholes in the Yamal Peninsula on northern Siberia are not sinkholes at all.

Those events occur annually from Mexico and Central America, to Florida and Pennsylvania.

Reviewing the onsite photos that scientists took showing deposits of earth blown around the rim of the crater, suggests the force came from within and not outside. The belching force runs counter to a hole that "sinks" or opens up due to water erosion.

What is the natural power behind the holes, which need to be renamed to depict the geologic process that creates them?

First seen as one massive, 260-foot diameter crater, the anomaly has since been joined by other such gigantic holes appearing in a different region of Siberia. From one to three or more such gaps, the anomaly has become a phenomenon. Perhaps worst, the trend casts a dark omen to the rapid changes man has injected into the climate -- the superheating of the planet by human activity.

The Early Start of Climate Change

What few people realize is that our carbon footprint began to altar the earth's geological clock 12,000 years ago. When Jesus Christ lived, he was supposed to walk on ice, not water.

In BCE, our ancient ancestors clear-cut the land for rice cultivation in Asia and farming in Europe and the Mid East. Their scorched earth living removed hundreds of thousands of square miles of forests. Those forests were carbon banks that have kept the earth balanced in a cycle of 90,000 years Ice Age and 10,000 years of warmth for the last four such epochs, according to geologist Kirsten Peters in her book, The Whole Story on Climate Change.

Now add the explosion of human population the past century combined with the burning of fossil fuels, and it's evident to see how we have impacted the planet.

Permafrost is melting in Siberia and in the tundra of Canada and Alaska. Scientists have seen an increase of frozen or trapped methane being released to the air.

The methane blowholes act line mini volcanoes. The buildup of stored methane gas -- dormant for millions of years -- being awaken by the warming earth has blown its "frost caps" off the top of the holes, ejecting layers of soil and sediment around the rims, while releasing tons of methane to the air.

How does process work?

Frozen Methane Hydrates Erupt

In the wake of the 2010 BP Oil Spill, forensic engineers figured out there was a build up of methane gas. It had leaked into the wellbore of the Deepwater Horizon oilrig. Once the gas migrated, it caused the explosion of the oilrig that claimed eleven lives. In its wake came the runaway oil spill that damaged coastlines from Texas to Florida and left a two-inch thick "oil-dispersed" carpet at the bottom of the gulf.

"For the oil spill, frozen hydrates acted like an ice plug. It melted as a result of the heat produced from the cementing operations on that tragic day," a nuclear engineer told me at the 2011 Offshore Technology Conference in Houston, Texas. "We use frozen nitrogen plugs all the time in the nuclear industry. The ice plugs temporarily dam one end of a pipe so that welded joints of other sections of pipe can be tested and inspected."

The same processes are taking place in Siberia. The giant ice plug melts with the heating of the permafrost, as the methane builds up to a tipping point and then erupts blowing open the soft ground.

This is the beginning of bad news for the earth.

"Methane, when released to the air, is 20 times more harmful than fossil fuels. But it lasts for a shorter duration of 20 years than the 100 years CO2 lasts in the atmosphere," said Cornell University's Jed P. Sparks in a separate interview.

Waking a "Sleeping Giant"

In a recent Nature article on the event, author Katia Moskvitch wrote:

"Air near the bottom of the crater contained unusually high concentrations of methane -- up to 9.6 percent -- in tests conducted at the site on 16 July, says Andrei Plekhanov, an archaeologist at the Scientific Centre of Arctic Studies in Salekhard, Russia. Plekhanov, who led an expedition to the crater, says that air normally contains just 0.000179 percent methane."

In other words, the amount of methane released from one giant blowhole has spiked the amount of methane into the air by tens of thousands of times greater than normal.

This is troubling, as methane is stored in two immense geological areas. Under the permafrost up north and as frozen hydrates on the seafloors of the continental shelves around the globe.

Vicious Feedback Loop

Methane hydrates are stable under low temperature conditions. But the era of stable permafrost in the ground and hydrates remaining frozen in warming oceans is over.

The question becomes how much methane exists naturally in the atmosphere today? And how more much methane can be released into the air over the next half century?

From studies I have read, there appears to be three to four times the amount of methane stored in peat bogs, permafrost, and in the sea floors. Released as gas into the air, the impact on global warming will be 20 times greater than the same amount of carbon dioxide released to the air.

Last year, the journal Nature published a paper, Climate Science: Vast Costs of Arctic Change.

Andrew Revkin of the New York Times and Washington Post's Jason Samenow debunked the paper's cost estimates, however, of a "$60 trillion price tag for a potential 50 Gigatonne methane pulse from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) over 10­50 years this century."

Both authors cited University of Chicago professor David Archer, who is "an expert on ocean sediments and methane."

Perhaps the trio should fly to Siberia next summer to see whether new methane blowholes have pocked the permafrost landscape. Even professor Archer, who is an expert on only one form of methane store in the sea, knows this law of physics:

"Energy is neither created nor destroyed. It is merely transferred."

It's the transfer from a stable environment into a volatile one in the atmosphere that should concern them and us.

With the polar ice cap shrinking in size, accelerated by too much snow and the warming of oceans, have created a negative feedback loop. The sun's reflective white shield of the arctic is shrinking in size. It's being replaced by heat-absorbing darker water.                                                                                                                                                        0000822-fd1ff3c4c50d98811b5a61d7f2027c0a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000047512 00000000000 015156  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Donald Trump panned “pay-to-play” politics, blasted "rigged" elections and vowed to "drain the swamp" that is Washington, D.C.

But Trump has so far forsaken the very government agency Congress created after Watergate to work as the nation’s campaign season Roto-Rooter.

The Federal Election Commission’s six commissioners, including the agency's three Republicans, say neither Trump nor his transition team has contacted them.

Trump, meanwhile, appointed Don McGahn, a former FEC chairman and preeminent enemy of campaign finance regulations, as his top White House lawyer. Representatives for the Trump transition declined to answer questions from the Center for Public Integrity about the FEC.

The developments together are evidence that the FEC — once a reasonably robust and bipartisan judge of political misdeeds — heads into 2017 even more marginalized than ever before by the very politicians it’s supposed to advise and police.

Making matters bleaker:

The FEC finds itself torn by internal strife between increasingly disgruntled employees and top agency managers

Its own inspector general in October stopped just short of declaring the FEC an operational disaster

While outward hostilities are less frequent, the agency’s commissioners continue to grapple with ideological impasses so pitched that at least two commissioners — Democrat Ann Ravel and Republican Caroline Hunter — barely speak to one another anymore

Every FEC commissioner but Ravel continues to serve despite his or her term having expired long ago, and some may soon quit the agency

Such FEC decreptitude also coincides with the body politic, having endured the most expensive and bruising presidential election in recent U.S. history, becoming overwhelmingly cynical and angry about how money affects elections.

Nearly nine in 10 Americans believe wealthy people will figure out new ways to influence politics, regardless of whether campaign finance laws are changed, according to a new Center for Public Integrity/IPSOS poll conducted in early December.

The poll also indicates that more than seven in 10 Americans want the federal government to impose moderate or strict contribution limits on super PACs — technically independent political committees that may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against candidates. They are not supposed to “coordinate” their spending with candidates’ campaigns.

Together, super PACs, politically active nonprofits and similar groups spent more than $743 million to influence the 2016 presidential election alone, the Center for Responsive Politics calculated. They include super PACs with close ties to Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton and other also-ran presidential candidates such as Republicans Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio.

The FEC’s newly minted chairman, longtime commissioner Steven Walther, will attempt to orchestrate his agency’s discord into something modestly more symphonic, at least on a couple of imminent matters: overseeing the agency’s move to a new headquarters and completing an overhaul of its outmoded website.

He defended the agency’s relevance, particularly as a campaign finance data clearinghouse.

“People who complain about the FEC would complain a lot more if it wasn’t there,” said Walther, a Democratic appointee who identifies as an independent and also served as agency chairman in 2009. “Sure, people here have strong views and don’t always agree. I wouldn’t expect anything else, and we’ll do what we can to work together.”

Outgoing FEC Chairman Matthew Petersen last year vowed to dial down intra-commission acrimony, which at its worst prompted bizarre, public debates about men’s nipples and space aliens. He concurred that 2016 is proof “we can disagree without being disagreeable” and “operate in a collegial manner.”

But Walther acknowledged he’s all but powerless to break deadlocks on the agency’s thorniest issues, such as defining political “dark money” or determining what constitutes illegal political activity.

Take the case this year of a coal company allegedly coercing employees to attend political rallies and make contributions. The commission deadlocked 3-3 along ideological lines, as it has on a variety of issues, and the matter died on their desks. Or another 3-3 case where a North Carolina nonprofit organization that seemingly existed only to promote Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., avoided registering as a political group and disclosing its funders despite protests from Democrats.

“Steve is an extremely gracious person who will make every effort to reach consensus,” said Ravel, who told the Center for Public Integrity that she will resign her seat no later than May, when her term expires. “But I can’t imagine anything changing at the agency except for it to become even more dysfunctional, the stalemates on significant matters to continue.”

In short, Democratic commissioners accuse their Republican colleagues of refusing to enforce some campaign finance rules at all. Republican commissioners argue that the Democrats regularly attempt to enforce campaign finance rules that simply don't exist.

Herein lies the root of the FEC’s existential problem: today’s commissioners frequently can’t agree on what the rules even are — something agency leaders from years past say wasn’t usually true.



First: repairing damage

Foremost on Walther’s immediate agenda is some internal housekeeping: walking floor-by-floor through the FEC’s nine-story building to speak face-to-face with the agency’s rank-and-file, who’ve been shaken this year by what many consider a gross breach of their trust.

At issue: FEC Inspector General Lynne McFarland accused one of the agency’s senior managers of misleading her into releasing confidential employee morale surveys that, in some cases, were highly critical of agency commissioners and managers.

The senior manager, Chief Compliance Officer Patricia Orrock, then shared the survey data with Staff Director Alec Palmer, Acting Deputy Staff Director Edward Holder and Human Resources Director Derrick Allen, as Petersen and Walther acknowledged in a Nov. 15 letter to National Treasury Employees Union President Anthony Reardon. The union represents FEC employees. Reardon called the situation “inexcusable.”

In the Nov. 15 letter, which the Center for Public Integrity obtained this month, Petersen and Walther told Reardon to “rest assured that if we become aware of any acts or threats, however subtle, of retaliation resulting from the information disclosed in the survey comments, or any protected activity in which an employee engages, we will ensure that appropriate measures are taken.”

They further described the situation as a “serious mistake” that “has resulted in an erosion of trust between FEC management and staff.” They vowed to “rectify, to the extent possible, any ill will that has been generated.”

Reardon, in an email, said his union “is reviewing the letter to determine next steps.” Orrock and Palmer did not respond to request for comment.

In the meantime, the FEC’s commissioners must grapple with some of the lowest staff morale among federal government agencies. It’s a staff that, on balance, considers the agency’s commissioners bickering blowhards, top managers ineffectual, career prospects bleak and work environment dreary. That’s according to the agency’s own “Root Causes of Low Employee Morale Study” from July 2016.

Some FEC employees also believe the work they do — preparing cases, developing briefings, birddogging political committees — is largely for naught, lost in the swirl of commissioners’ ideological advocacy and posturing.

"Abiding by the law as written"

Take Election 2016 itself.

Political neophytes could be forgiven for believing that the FEC would aggressively pursue law-breaking candidates and political committees, including the big-spending super PACs and “social welfare” nonprofits that have profoundly influenced campaigns since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. FEC decision in January 2010.

But no.



One measure of how the FEC’s law enforcement function has diminished is the fines it levies. During fiscal year 2016, the agency doled out about $788,000 in civil penalties, according to agency records. That’s the lowest amount in any presidential election year since 1992.

A single case — a surprising unanimous vote to fine three nonprofit groups once connected to conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch — accounted for almost one-third of the FEC’s fines this year.

The 2016 fines also represent a fraction of the high-water mark the agency set a decade earlier, in 2006, when it hit dozens of political committees with a collective $5.92 million in fines.

That year, the average FEC fine for the most severe enforcement cases was about $179,500; the average such fine in 2016 was about $19,850, FEC records show.

Hunter, the incoming vice chairwoman, says fewer fines mean — at least in part — that political candidates and committees are doing a better job voluntarily complying with campaign laws. She credits an FEC staff that this year reviewed more than 24 million pages of campaign finance documents and fielded 13,000 phone calls.

“People in politics don’t want to get it wrong,” Hunter said. “And the FEC has done a good job of abiding by the law as written.”

On the contrary, said Craig Holman of government reform organization Public Citizen.

“The FEC is now the weakest it’s ever been, and it’s completely dysfunctional on key issues,” he said.

Either way, justice for those who might skirt campaign laws is slow.

The most recent 15 enforcement cases the FEC resolved took, on average, 675 days to close, according to agency records. That’s roughly the gestation period of an elephant.

Some blame falls with the commissioners, who periodically hold up the most contentious cases for one reason or another. But delays also originate in the agency’s Office of General Counsel, which hasn’t had a permanent leader since July 2013, when General Counsel Anthony Herman resigned to re-enter private practice.

Of the 274 open complaints pending at the FEC in early December, 224 were awaiting action by the Office of General Counsel, commissioners confirmed. Another 21 were pending before commissioners themselves. The rest are under active investigation. The FEC will likely settled some and head to federal court on others in an effort to enforce provisions in the Federal Election Campaign Act or other federal election laws.

Commissioner Lee Goodman, a Republican, noted that the FEC typically experiences a higher-than-normal caseload volume during election years. Many of the complaints pending at the FEC will be closed without controversy because of flimsy evidence or clear lack of merit.

But financial and personnel limitations are also a major factor, said Daniel Petalas, who resigned in September as the FEC’s acting general counsel to join the D.C. office of law firm Garvey Schubert Barer.

“We had limited resources, and there’s only so much we can do at the supervisory level, even if the quality of the work product was, I feel, exceptional,” Petalas said. “There are all sorts of stresses on the staff … Your client is a six-headed hydra that’s always fighting with itself and often taking on the body itself.”

Such fighting also continued to chill political committees’ interest in asking the FEC for formal legal advice by requesting what’s called an “advisory opinion” from the commission.

The FEC this year has voted on just 22 such requests — tied with 2008 for the lowest number ever during a presidential election year. In 1976, the first presidential year after the FEC’s creation, it fielded 117 advisory opinion requests.

These days, most political committees are content avoiding the hassle and expense of going before the commission and taking their chances that the FEC, even if they break a law, couldn’t agree that they did.

Some room for agreement

Earlier this month, the FEC, as it does every year, sends what amounts to a Christmas wish list to Congress.

This year’s list was longer than others and previews priorities that, while modest in scope, constitute rare common ground among all commissioners.

Of particular note, the FEC wants the U.S. Senate to file its campaign finance disclosures electronically, saving taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. They also want more power to sanction political committees that misrepresent themselves. The authority to pay top managers more money — key in attracting qualified candidates — is also essential, they argue.

The problem: Congress almost always ignores the FEC’s requests. So no matter how much commissioners themselves concur, they’re all but powerless to determine, structurally, how campaigns are funded and waged.

Commissioners are therefore resigned in 2017 to give up on blasting any regulatory home runs and will try, as Petersen and Walther both put it, to “hit singles.”

Petersen, for his part, wants to conduct a public hearing on how rapidly evolving technology is changing political campaigns. Such a hearing, if it occurs, would almost certainly reignite debate over political advertising on the internet — a flashpoint this year between Goodman and Ravel, in particular, and one that even led to Ravel receiving death threats.

Goodman says he’ll continue his push to relax regulations affecting how state and local political parties operate — something on which the commission’s Democrats have shown a willingness to work.

He also wants to address how the commission responds to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, saying the agency gives its staff too much power in determining what information is released — or withheld. “I do not believe the Commission complies with the Freedom of Information Act or its own regulations when it asserts exemptions and privileges to public requests for records,” Goodman said.

Democratic Commissioner Ellen Weintraub says the FEC is motivated to crack down on so-called “scam PACs” that, under the guise of supporting a candidate, generally exist to make money for the people associated with the political committee.

Commissioners — especially Walther — also cited the specter of foreign money seeping into U.S. elections as an area of shared interest.

Major changes ahead?

One commissioner — Ravel — says she’ll quit the agency by May, when her term expires.

She says she hasn’t decided what she’ll do next, but that it likely will involve working for a foundation or, perhaps, in the private sector. She’ll depart the FEC having largely seen her standing goal of revealing sources of secret money in politics stymied.

Goodman, in an interview, wouldn’t commit to staying at the FEC through 2017.

“I will make a decision early next year about my future plans,” he said.

The four other commissioners say they have no immediate plans to leave the commission, but Hunter and Petersen, in particular, could prove attractive prospects for other postings in what’s now Republican-dominated Washington, D.C.

And, save for Ravel, all of the FEC commissioners’ six-year terms have expired. But they continue to serve, because no law compels them to leave, and their authority remains the same. Come April, Weintraub will have served 10 years past her term’s expiration date, Walther eight years. Petersen’s term ended nearly six years ago, Hunter’s term four years ago.



“Congress has limited commissioners to one six-year term, and that was precisely because at the time many commissioners had been there for many years,” said Brad Smith, a former Republican FEC chairman who now leads the Center for Competitive Politics, which favors campaign deregulation. “Clearly, Congress did not want commissioners being there forever.”



A worst-case scenario in 2017?

The FEC can’t maintain the four commissioners needed by law to punish campaign scofflaws, issue formal guidance to political candidates and committees and conduct other high-level business.

This last happened at the FEC in 2008, and it prevented the agency from making many important decisions.

President Obama could yet nominate FEC commissioners before his term expires on Jan. 20.

But Obama last nominated FEC commissioners in mid-2013, when he floated Ravel and Goodman, and he has only nominated three commissioners overall during his nearly eight years in office.

Obama, meanwhile, has continued in recent weeks to nominate people to other governmental posts, including an under secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs, an inspector general for the National Security Agency and a judge for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

White House spokeswoman Katie Hill declined to comment on whether Obama will nominate new FEC commissioners.

If Obama doesn’t make FEC nominations, the job falls to Trump, whose transition team is already struggling to fill thousands of other federal government jobs.

Were Trump to take it, it would be a “unique opportunity” for his administration to “clean the deck” and name a full slate of new commissioners, said Michael Toner, a former Republican FEC chairman and a current partner at law firm Wiley Rein.

The nation is also experiencing an era when federal courts — think the Citizens United decision, among other recent and pivotal cases — are most responsible for profound changes in election law.

McGahn, the former FEC chairman now serving as Trump’s White House counsel, will play a pivotal role in identifying a new Supreme Court nominee, meaning the high court’s next justice is likely to favor fewer, not more, campaign regulations.

“I would assume he would be very involved and influential in those discussions,” said Petersen, who has stayed in touch with McGahn since he resigned from the FEC in 2013. McGahn did not respond to requests for comment.

Ravel says McGahn’s role in the Trump administration is a “strong indication to me that [Trump] doesn’t consider campaign finance to be a very significant issue.”

Also expect Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to involve himself in all major campaign finance matters, as he has for years.

This includes legislation congressional members float — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for one, wants to end limits on how much money donors may directly give political candidates — and the appointment of new FEC commissioner nominees, who the Senate must approve.

Weintraub, the FEC’s longest-serving commissioner, says Trump could surprise everyone and stick to his promises to “drain the swamp” in D.C., and set a higher standard for what’s legal and ethical during elections.

Campaign finance reform group Issue One — a bipartisan group that includes 150 former members of Congress — agrees. It’s prodding Trump to support an idea that Congress hasn’t yet seriously considered: turning the six-member FEC into a five-member body with a chairman who serves a 10-year term.

A five-member body could end what many view as its current “permanent gridlock,” said Issue One senior strategic adviser Tim Roemer, a Democrat who previously represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representative and served as U.S. ambassador to India under Obama.

“It was a good idea to fix the FEC when Obama was president, and it’s still a good idea to fix the FEC now that Trump is president,” he said.

Weintraub, for her part, says she can’t envision Congress or Trump championing political disclosure or strengthening election laws.

“Get better? Good luck,” Weintraub said. “I’m hoping not to see things get worse.”

It was the last jump of the night, the last jump of the biggest night of the Olympics. No one was watching the high jump.

It might also be his last jump at first Olympics. He had twice missed the height at 2.29m. But he was made to wait, Usain Bolt was about to run.

They probably wanted to stop anyway for it is the race the world watches, but when the entire battery of trackside photographers charged through the high jumpers run-up area to get to Bolt's celebrations at the finish line they really had no choice.

"I didn't realise the record for the 400 was broken. I realised there was a lot of noise. I think I was just about to jump and I think I fed off that a little bit. And then the 100 metres was on as well it was a big night and I am glad I was a part of it," Starc said.                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000821-54b9918a76ead3b8958b4a3a56984443.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005014 00000000000 014704  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Every year, stormwater runoff carries tons of trash and debris from the streets and streams of the Jones Fall watershed down into the mouth of the Jones Falls stream and out into the Baltimore Harbor. “I was tired of always hearing tourists say ‘ugh, this harbor’s disgusting’,” says Water Wheel co-founder John Kellett. “I thought, there’s got to be a better way than collecting trash on our front doorstep.” After a successful prototype and securing the support of the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore, the world’s first Water Wheel was constructed in just seven months with a crew of less than four men.

Here’s how it works: two orange booms help funnel debris towards the Water Wheel, where spring-loaded leaf rakes intercept the trash and push it onto a moving conveyer belt which empties out into a 16 yard dumpster, located on top of a floating dock. Once the dumpster is full, the dock is detached, hooked up to a boat, and then taken to a RESCO waste-to-energy plant, where the trash is incinerated and turned into electrical energy. The solar-powered pumps move 20,000 gallons of water an hour onto the rotating waterwheel that turns the conveyer belt.

In addition to cleaning up the harbor, the Water Wheel also provides other benefits. The constant rotation of the waterwheel puts much needed oxygen back into the water, helping to attract schools of fish and improve habitat conditions and water quality. The trash collector also removes organic waste, which if left to decompose, causes oxygen depletion and releases ammonia. As a project of the Healthy Harbor Living Laboratory, the Water Wheel also serves to educate people about stormwater management and the Inner Harbor.

“Baltimore will soon pass a trash TMDL (total maximum daily load) or ‘pollution diet,’ that will legally require the city to remove a certain amount of trash from the water bodies a year,” says Adam Lindquist, Healthy Harbor Manager. “Our hope is to put the Water Wheel out of business.” While the Water Wheel will be a permanent fixture of Baltimore for now, there are talks of adding another one to the mouth of Washington D.C.’s trash-clogged Anacostia River.

Graduate student Irum Abassi was wearing a head scarf when she was ordered to leave a flight on Sunday before it took off from San Diego International Airport.

Abassi told reporters at a news conference that a Southwest crew member thought Abassi said, “It’s a go” — or something to that effect — in a conversation on her cell phone.

“They weren’t even sure what I said,” Abassi said.

She added that what she actually said was “I’ve got to go,” because she could not talk on the phone during take-off.

“We sincerely apologize for the customer’s inconvenience, and we regret that she was unable to travel as scheduled,” the airline said in a statement.

Southwest said Abassi was asked to deplane because of her behavior prior to take-off, but declined to elaborate.

Abassi was given a ticket for the next flight to her destination of San Jose, California and a travel voucher as a gesture of goodwill, the airline said.

But Abassi said that the experience left her in tears.

“I could not imagine this happening to me,” she said.

In a separate incident, on Sunday a Jewish prayer observance by three passengers aboard an Alaska Airlines flight from Mexico City to Los Angeles alarmed flight attendants unfamiliar with the ritual, prompting them to lock down the cockpit and issue a security alert, officials said.

The three men, all Mexican nationals, were escorted off the plane by police and questioned by the FBI, before being released to make connecting flights to other countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0000724-dc4e2f1a268386c07617ab139f5cb4fc.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006415 00000000000 015165  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Fueled by post recession homebuyers hungry for affordable sleek and green design, “prefabs” or modular homes can offer a sustainable, customizable and competitively priced alternative to the overpriced and — let’s be honest — not overly exciting suburban dwellings of Sonoma County.

As prefabs gain popularity, homebuyers can now choose from a range of local suppliers of a variety of models and layouts. By relocating the building site to factories, the prefab solution provides a more controlled construction process and more reliable project pricing while eliminating the old model of general contractor estimates, change orders and unwelcome surprises.

Blu Homes, founded by environmental documentary filmmaker and technology savant Bill Haney, is at the forefront of the Bay Area prefab movement. The Vallejo based company employs quality craftsmanship and thoughtful design, and uses recyclable, earthquake proof, steel-reinforced frames for its cutting edge homes. Premium building materials afford Blu Home owners 50 percent lower operating costs, which can amount to more than $7,000 in energy savings over a ten year period.

As the startup’s streamlined Scandinavian style continues to gain international recognition, notable designers and architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright’s grandson Tim Wright, have begun to show appreciation for the company’s artisanal energy. (Wright recently constructed his very own Blu Home near Taliesin). In 2012, Blu Homes co-designed an “Idea House” for Sunset Magazine in Healdsburg. The company regularly hosts public viewings of its Sonoma County properties and recently launched “Blu Design Studio App,” allowing customers to design their very own virtual dream home via smartphone or tablet.

Another prefab venture that has gained momentum in Sonoma County is Method Homes. The company promises to deliver a custom home 60 percent faster than traditional site-built construction, which means customers can move into their new home in less than four months and on a fixed budget. All Method homes are built using sustainable and healthy materials, systems, and practices. The company does not use VOC paints or UA formaldehyde in building materials, instead it utilizes local products whenever possible and standard house models come with FSC certified hardwood floors, locally harvested lumber, dual flush toilets, low-flow fixtures, pre-wiring for solar and above-code insulation.

Method Homes partners with notable designers and architects: recent collaborations include a Cloverdale home designed by award winning studio Chris Pardo Design and a Tahoe Cabin by Balance Associates Architects. At 2,300 square feet, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom Cloverdale home took just four months to complete and features a ground level patio, a roof deck right off the top floor living area and plenty of outdoor space to enjoy the views of the rolling Sonoma hills.

Prefabs or modular homes can be financed with an FHA insured loan (all the way up to 96.5 percent) and with a conventional mortgage. Standard mortgage requirements include a middle 620 credit score as well as 10 percent equity. While there is a persistent shortage of housing in Sonoma County, there is still plenty of acreage available for the prefab enthusiast, with some lots below the $100K mark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0000738-e0fd63aeedc99c9af13cfba09f1e8bcb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012015 00000000000 015706  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Top 30 Medicinal Plants To Learn For Survival

When SHTF, it won’t be long before modern medicines are hard to come by, so you need a back-up plan. That’s OK though because there’s a form of medicine that can be just as effective and has been in use for millennia: herbs and plants.

That’s right. Eastern medicine, as well as Native Americans and many other cultures, used natural cures long before Western medicine even thought about a pill.

Here’s a list of medicinal plants to learn for survival.

Althea. Grows in well-drained soil in either sun or shade. Great for skin irritations, ulcers and sore throats. American Ginseng. This root grows best in cool climates and is used to treat respiratory disorders and reduce fevers. It’s used orally, often in a tea. Barberry. This grows to as high as a whopping 9 feet tall! Use it to treat skin conditions and diarrhea. Belladonna. Great to use as a sleep aid but be extremely careful; too much belladonna will kill. Billberry. Grow these berries in full sun. Use them to ease diabetes pain, and to treat kidney disease and eye conditions. Eat the berries. Borage. Grows well in full sun and moderate to moist soil. Helps with arthritis, joint pain and skin conditions such as eczema. Catnip. Grows well in many soils. Treats cold symptoms, swelling and fever.

The National Association of Tower Erectors (NATE) and the Wireless Infrastructure Association (WIA) applauded the FCC’s significant vote to seek public comment on a plan to exclude from routine historic preservation review the collocation of wireless communications equipment on “twilight towers”. It has been estimated by the FCC that those structures total more than 4,200 nationwide.

The affirmative vote from FCC Commissioners took place during today’s open FCC meeting and addresses an issue that for too long has placed the industry in regulatory limbo.

The public benefit of making existing twilight towers available for collocation, as recognized by the FCC, are:

– Less intrusive – for environment and historic/cultural sites – than new towers

– Vast majority likely have no adverse effects

– Enabling collocation facilitates wireless and wireless broadband coverage nationwide

– Congress directed FirstNet to leverage existing infrastructure

Twilight towers are communication structures built between March 16, 2001 and March 7, 2005 that have not been eligible for collocations in the same way as towers that have documented Section 106 historic preservation review and clearance or towers that were exempted due to being built prior to the pre 2001 Standard.

“NATE sincerely appreciates the solutions-oriented leadership displayed today by Chairman Ajit Pai and Commissioners Brendan Carr, Mignon Clyburn, Michael O’Rielly and Jessica Rosenworcel in order to address the regulatory status of twilight towers in a manner that will ultimately open up thousands of communication structures for wireless colocation deployment activities,” stated Executive Director Todd Schlekeway.

“NATE member companies are on the front lines building, deploying and maintaining wireless infrastructure in the United States and today’s action by the FCC is yet another positive development for our membership as we continue to lead the way on the road to 5G,” added Schlekeway.

“This is an historic win for the wireless industry,” said Jonathan Adelstein, President and CEO of WIA. “This decision opens up more wireless infrastructure and strengthens mobile networks so that the industry can provide greater service to consumers across the country. These facilities will help us meet the explosive growth in demand for wireless data as our industry continues to roll out the most advanced mobile networks in the world.”

WIA worked closely with CTIA to provide the FCC with comments regarding the issue and also participating in meetings and workshops.

Earlier this year, Commissioner O’Rielly addressed industry stakeholders at WIA’s annual conference in Orlando. Among other important issues, O’Rielly made it clear that he wanted to resolve the issue and free up these valuable facilities for collocation. “My goal is to ensure that we put an end to the twilight towers issue once and for all,” he said.

The decision to open up twilight towers to collocation is also based on the limited likelihood that any of the affected facilities actually had any impact on historic properties. As WIA pointed out to the FCC, the majority of wireless infrastructure projects reviewed through the Tribal consultation process have had no adverse effects on historic properties.

“There is no reason to believe twilight towers are any different that towers that were built during any other time period,” Adelstein said. “No formal complaints were filed by a Tribe or a Tribal Historic Preservation Office claiming a tower has had an adverse effect on their cultural preservation efforts. In fact, opening up twilight towers will actually reduce the number of new towers and therefore reduce the amount of ground disturbance that comes with new construction.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000871-b817eec195e3e3e0ff0dca5225024ab3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011351 00000000000 015224  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        LONDON: The UPA government sought to tap into Vodafone’s network to intercept calls, text messages and emails last year. India was among 29 countries to make such requests.Citing Indian laws on secrecy, the British telecom company, in its first ever exhaustive “Law Enforcement Disclosure report”, did not mention the number of requests India made or say if it complied with them. India is Vodafone’s biggest market.The UK government was granted 2,760 warrants to tap communications content — listening to actual call content — and 514,608 warrants to intercept communications metadata, or a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.Vodafone said Indian law obliges service providers to maintain extreme secrecy on lawful interception. “In Albania, Egypt, Hungary, India, Malta, Qatar, Romania, South Africa and Turkey, it is unlawful to disclose any information related to wiretapping or interception of the content of phone calls and messages including whether such capabilities exist,” it said.Revealing the scope of surveillance, the company also revealed that in six countries where it operates — it did not name them — secret wires were used directly by governments to listen in on and record live conversations.Vodafone, in its first-ever ‘Law Enforcement Disclosure’ report, said law enforcement and national security legislation in the countries it operates in often include stringent restrictions on disclosing any information relating to the demands made by authorities for interception of calls, messages and other data, besides disclosure of aggregate statistics.Vodafone revealed that all demands made by security agencies are processed ‘blind’ with no information whatsoever about the context.“Whilst we can — and do — challenge demands that are not compliant with legal due process or seem disproportionate, it is… not possible… to ascertain the intended purpose of any demand received. Equally, we cannot assess whether or not the information gathered as a result of a demand will be used in a manner which is lawful, nor, in most cases, can we make any judgment about the potential consequences of complying (or failing to comply) with an individual demand,” Vodafone said.In many countries, operators are also prohibited from giving the public any insight into the means by which those demands are implemented. “We respect the law in each of the countries we operate. We believe this form of transparency is as important as the publication of aggregate demand statistics themselves in terms of ensuring greater public understanding in this area,” it said.Almost three billion people now communicate and share information over electronic communication networks on a regular basis and vast volumes of data are created and exchanged every second. The company decided to break its silence on government surveillance after allegations that operators were hand in glove in the widespread use of phone tapping to spy on citizens. “Refusal to comply with a country’s laws is not an option. If we do not comply with a lawful demand for assistance, governments can remove our licence to operate, preventing us from providing services to our customers,” it said.“However, in every country in which we operate, we have to abide by the laws of those countries which require us to disclose information about our customers to law enforcement agencies or other government authorities, or to block or restrict access to certain services,” Vodafone said, adding, “Those laws are designed to protect national security and public safety or to prevent or investigate crime and terrorism, and the agencies and authorities that invoke those laws insist that the information demanded from communications operators such as Vodafone is essential to their work.“Refusal to comply with a country’s laws is not an option. If we do not comply with a lawful demand for assistance, governments can remove our licence to operate, preventing us from providing services to our customers. Our employees who live and work in the country concerned may also be at risk of criminal sanctions, including imprisonment.”Vodafone further said, “In a number of countries, these changes have created tensions between the protection of the citizen’s right to privacy and the duty of the state to ensure public safety and security. Those tensions have been heightened as a consequence of the allegations made by the former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Media reports of widespread government surveillance and data ‘harvesting’ by intelligence agencies have triggered a significant public debate about the transparency, proportionality and legitimacy — even lawfulness — of the alleged activities of a number of high-profile agencies,” it added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0000804-145a11207952134216f5219fc18805ad.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010317 00000000000 014422  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Image caption The high resolution of 8K screens means you can stand very close to them without seeing the individual pixels

Sharp has announced plans to sell an 8K television screen from October.

Although several companies have developed "super hi-vision" resolution test models, this is the first such TV to be made commercially available.

The 8K format provides 16 times as many pixels as 1080p high definition. It creates an image so detailed that it can appear three-dimensional.

However, the 85in (2.16m) device's 16m yen ($133,000; £86,000) price is likely to limit sales.

Interest is expected to come mainly from broadcasters and other companies involved in testing the format.

One analyst suggested it would not become a serious proposition for members of the public until the turn of the decade.

"We're not expecting 8K TVs targeted at consumers to be released until at least 2016, and we don't expect they will cross one million units until after 2019," said Abhi Mallick, from IHS Technology.

"Japan's NHK is the only broadcaster so far to announce plans to create and broadcast 8K content."

But he added that the relatively small size of people's homes in Japan might mean many families would not be interested.

"Japan's a region in which the average size of TVs sold tends to be smaller, and we think the minimum size 8K TVs would be sold at would be 65in."

He added that for the time being, he expected manufacturers to focus their efforts on trying to convince families to buy 4K sets instead.

They provide a quarter of the resolution of 8K, but are being made in sizes of up to about 100in to create "cinema-like" experiences in the home.

8K video walls

Due to technological restraints, owners of Sharp's LV-85001 will have to use workarounds to take advantage of its full capabilities.

Its built-in TV tuner cannot actually receive broadcasts in 8K. Instead, video has to be fed in via four separate HDMI cables, which are needed to handle the quantities of data involved.

The resulting image delivers 104 pixels per inch.

That is about a fifth of the density of modern high-end smartphone displays, but is more than enough to allow people to read relatively small-sized text or make out intricate details when standing close to the screen.

While 8K content and 8K cameras are still rare, the Japanese news site AV Watch, which was first to report Sharp's TV, suggested the product could be used in hospitals to provide keyhole surgeons with better imagery.

Each frame would contain the same detail as a 33.2 megapixel photo.

Another expert suggested the tech might appeal to marketers.

"The attraction will be for commercial applications - video walls and things like that," said Chris Green, a tech consultant at Davies Murphy Group.

"8K screens could offer a very interesting video alternative to today's shop window and billboard displays - which show static advertising - because their extreme clarity means they can show lots of text and would be as readable as a poster."

Japan v China

Japan's NHK streamed live 8K footage from last year's World Cup in Brazil and intends to begin public tests of the format over satellite in 2016.

The corporation plans to show all of Tokyo's 2020 Olympic Games in 8K and begin regular broadcasts in super hi-vision resolution the same year.

However, IHS Technology believes it could be China that drives initial demand for the technology.

"China has had the fastest adoption of 4K televisions in the world - there is a demographic there of higher income consumers who want to buy TVs that will impress their neighbours," said Mr Mallick.

"That's often regardless of whether they can accept the content.

"Many of the early 4K TVs that were shipped into China lacked HDMI 2.0 ports, so they won't be able to receive 4K content that's since become available from set-top boxes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0000910-c32a7fa2abc48d48c205bfd9ee351984.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007706 00000000000 015250  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A new report has found that transitioning to a clean energy economy would be an economic boon to the United States, increasing employment, reducing costs to consumers, and benefiting investors.

The report, from NextGen Climate America, showed that investment in efficiency, renewable sources of electricity, and fuel switching — such as moving from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric vehicles — would add a million jobs by 2030, and roughly 2 million jobs by 2050, while increasing GDP by $290 billion and improving household income. The researchers looked at scenarios that would reduce emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels.

“While addressing climate change is one of our greatest challenges, it is one of our greatest opportunities to build the economy,” Tom Steyer, co-founder of NextGen and billionaire climate activist (and a board member of the Center for American Progress), said on a call with reporters Monday.

The construction industry, in particular, could see a huge bump in jobs — to the tune of 1.2 million more in 2050 than under the business-as-usual scenario. That’s because it will take a lot of people to build the wind farms, install the solar panels, and retrofit the buildings needed to reduce America’s dependence on fossil fuels.

The go-to argument against [climate action] is that it’s bad for the economy and it’s a job killer

Efforts to lower emissions are often subject to the criticism that they will hurt the economy, even though actual examples of programs have shown that efficiency and clean energy programs can actually boost economic factors like household disposable income.

“The go-to argument against [climate action] is that it’s bad for the economy and it’s a job killer,” Steyer said. This report shows otherwise. Steyer also pointed out that in the last few years, jobs in the solar industry have grown 20 times faster than the rest of the economy.

In addition, the so-called reference case — a general economic forecast — did not take into account the potential costs of not addressing climate change. Recent reports have shown climate change poses a significant financial risk.

The report studiously stays away from telling policymakers how to get to 80 percent less emissions. Rather than policy recommendations, the researchers took a feasibility study and used it to build out the economic impacts. The researchers used a 2014 report, Pathways to Deep Decarbonization in the United States by Energy and Environmental Economics, which looked at whether it was technologically feasible to reduce carbon emissions significantly enough to avoid 2°C warming.

Economist Jeffery Sachs told reporters it was critical to first determine where we want to go, and then tailor policies to achieve those end goals.

“Too often our national policy conversation jumps straight to the question, ‘Is it a tax? Is it this or that?’ Whereas what this report does, much better, in my opinion, is to show here’s where we want to go,” Sachs said.

Overall, the report painted an optimistic picture of the economy under a clean energy scenario. It’s worth noting, though, that the gains will not be across the board. Job growth in two of the nine regions was expected slow under the low-carbon scenarios. Those two regions — which include roughly the area from Montana to Texas, a fossil fuel heavy swath of the country — would have slower job growth.

That means that as the country does develop policies to achieve these goals, it will likely need to dedicate resources — educational and economic — to areas that will have a harder time getting off fossil fuels.

“To help them adapt we need to provide dedicated new resources for economic diversification, job creation, job training and other employment services for workers and communities affected by job losses at coal mines and coal-fired power plants,” the authors said.

Jobs notwithstanding, all regions were found to see increases in disposable income.                                                          0000907-0588658203f1ffc0d86c0c1be6c054db.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007164 00000000000 015105  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Did you win a trip to Washington last month to meet President Trump at the Trump Victory Dinner at Trump International Hotel?

Someone did, or was supposed to, according to a post on the official website of Donald J. Trump for President. But the Trump campaign won’t say who it was.

The Trump campaign, which advertised the effort on Facebook, promoted a drawing to win “round-trip transportation and accommodations and tickets to attend a dinner with President Trump at the June 28, 2017, Trump Victory Dinner in Washington, D.C. (approximate retail value $3,000).”

The lucky winner might have had to come up with another $3,000 to bring a spouse, since the rules specified that “One (1) winners [sic]” would get the flight, room, dinner and opportunity to “meet President Trump, and have your picture taken with him so you can remember this moment forever.”

It was part of a fundraising pitch common to presidential campaigns throughout the years: Anyone who met the requirements (U.S. citizens or lawful residents over 18) and clicked on a box to make a contribution (suggested amounts ranged from $35 to $2,700) was automatically entered to win, although a donation was not required.

The entry period ran from June 2 to midnight on June 25. This apparently gave the campaign less than three days until the June 28 dinner to choose and notify a winner and arrange the travel logistics, Secret Service vetting and other details. The winner would have had even less time to pick out what to wear.

The dinner was to be held in conjunction with a fundraiser where tickets prices started at $35,000. The lavish event drew criticism because it was held at Trump’s own hotel in Washington and continued a trend of Trump’s businesses making money from his campaign events. Trump’s ventures earned more than $14 million from his presidential bid last year.

The Trump hotel event benefited a pair of joint fundraising committees that mainly distribute their income to Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee. When Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, raised money for his campaign and at Democratic Party events, press was generally allowed to cover his speeches. After pressure from the press corps, the White House said media would be allowed into Trump’s event. They changed their mind at the last minute and disinvited reporters.

Since the fundraiser was closed to the press, there is no public record of who the lucky winner was, or how much he or she enjoyed the experience. Many reporters flocked to Trump’s hotel on the night of the event though they were not allowed in the area where the event was held, and at least one was allegedly kicked out. Yahoo White House correspondent Hunter Walker set up shop in the hotel’s steakhouse, where Trump’s preferred table was reserved. Multiple sources said they expected Trump to dine at the steakhouse that evening, but the president never showed up.

Giving away dinners with political figures has become a common fundraising tool. Both Obama and Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent in last year’s race, held similar contests. And both Obama and Clinton have revealed the names of the winners of these events.

Yahoo News contacted the Trump campaign to see if they would share the name of the lucky dinner winner. Michael Glassner, executive director of Trump’s campaign, referred us to the Republican National Committee, which he said organized the event, but the RNC has not responded to multiple requests for comment.

Someone must have won. Was it you? If you’d like to tell us about the dinner, let us know at: Iwasthere2017@yahoo.com

Credit Suisse is out with its Global Wealth Report for 2013, looking at the distribution of household wealth around the world. Lukas Alpert of the Wall Street Journal pulls out the eye-popping stat that 35 percent of Russia’s wealth is now concentrated in the hands of just 110 people. Russia has just one billionaire for every $11 billion in household wealth compared to one for every $170 billion worldwide.

Worldwide, “personal wealth increased by 4.9 percent during the year to mid-2013 and now totals USD $241 trillion,” according to the report. U.S. wealth increased by 12.7 percent to $72.1 trillion. But as the charts below, whether you look at the change in wealth in total figures or in percentage, it was a rough year for Japan, which lost $5.8 trillion, or 20 percent of its net worth largely due to the falling yen/dollar exchange rate:

Ignore the big percentage change for Libya, which has had unreliable statistics for the last few years.

As the chart below shows, even with the rise of the BRICS countries, North America and Europe still control a disproportionate amount of the world’s wealth:

According to the report, there are currently 98,700 “ultra high net worth individuals,” those whose net worth exceeds $50 million. 45 percent of them live in the United States.                                       0000819-7c1df4750b90b2760f6572473ecf985b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000016542 00000000000 014773  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Fifty years ago this month, the United States began the embargo on Cuba which continues to this day. But the country against which it was aimed is rapidly becoming a very different one to the alleged communist menace just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. Under Fidel Castro's brother, Raul, it is in the throes of a second Cuban revolution.

For a sign of the change which is turning life on their island on its head, the people of Havana have only to peer into the night at the northern horizon. This month, Repsol, the Spanish energy company started drilling the first oil well from a massive and brightly lit rig, the lumbering Scarabeo 9, built in China for ENI of Italy. This morning it will still be grinding away seeking the billions of barrels of oil and the trillions of cubic feet of gas that the US government, among others, says lie under Cuba's offshore waters.

The Spanish oilmen working on the structure, which has been towed halfway around the world amid US efforts to delay its progress, will be followed aboard by a succession of Norwegians, Russians, Indians and Malaysians.

Optimistic geologists reckon that within a few years the island – long cursed by a lack of oil supplies, half of which it has had to import – will actually be exporting the stuff. And it will be able to do so without the aid of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela who has kept the island's motors, power and air-conditioning going with his subsidised crude.

Also, at the fine harbour in Mariel, a few miles to the west of the Cuban capital, is another pointer to the future, the big island-changing harbour that Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant, is building with a large wodge of money provided by the booming South American nation.

The end of the first national conference of the Cuban Communist Party set the seal last month on changes that President Raul Castro had been building up to. Since he took over from his ailing elder brother, Fidel, in 2006, the new president, himself an octogenarian, has pushed ahead with measures which are turning the traditional Cuban lifestyle upside down by decreeing that the party will henceforward cease micro-managing daily life and confine itself to strategic matters.

Landscapers are working hard on matters of equally urgent national strategy. Fifteen more golf courses and new marinas are being laid out in Cuba and they can't be finished quickly enough: golfers from abroad will even be able to lease chalets and timeshares. The island's hotels are packed. European visitors are pouring in. After decades of US-imposed isolation from high-speed internet, Cubans and their visitors are finally beginning to receive it via a new cable laid from Venezuela.

Yet Raul's strategies are not confined to big infrastructure projects; they reach down deeper into an effort to keep Cuban society together. Senior Cuban figures make no secret of the fact that even more important work has to be done to improve Cubans' ideological outlook and the economic conditions.

"Whole generations have long since grown up with no personal knowledge of the heroic days before and after what we call 'the Triumph of the Revolution'," says one. New Year's Day 1959 was when General Fulgencio Batista, a dictator armed and honoured by the West, fled with suitcases of banknotes and valuables as Castro's forces got their hands on Havana. Few remember the abortive 1961 Bay of Pigs operation, the tragi-comic fiasco of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy to conquer the country.

The US embargo, introduced on 7 February 1962, is a constant talking point for island authorities, who blame it for shortages of everything from medical equipment to the concrete needed to complete an eight-lane highway running the length of the island. Cuba frequently fulminates against the "blockade" at the United Nations and demands the US end its "genocidal" policy. Every autumn, like clockwork, the vast majority of nations agree, and overwhelmingly back a resolution condemning the embargo. Last November, 186 countries supported the measure, with only Israel joining the US.

Wayne Smith was a young US diplomat in Havana in 1961 when relations were severed. He returned as the chief American diplomat after they were partially re-established under President Jimmy Carter. "We talk to the Russians, we talk to the Chinese, we have normal relations even with Vietnam. We trade with all of them," Smith said. "So why not with Cuba?"

The United States actually does have significant trade with Cuba under a clause allowing the sale of food products and some pharmaceuticals. According to the most recent information available from Cuba's National Statistics Office, the US was the island's seventh-largest trading partner in 2010, selling $410m (£260m) in mostly food products. However, that was down from nearly $1bn in 2008, as the island increasingly turned to other countries that don't force it to pay cash up front.

As Raul gave his closing speech at the party's first national congress, it was announced that new laws would allow people to sell their crumbling houses and wheezing cars. With the lonely support of only one ally, Israel, Washington has insisted on continuing six decades of crippling boycott on trade with Cuba despite overwhelming condemnation of it in the UN for the past 19 years.

But no longer will Cubans be obliged to leave their homes or their vehicles to their children, or do dodgy swaps with strangers. More than one million of the 4.3 million state employees will be encouraged to form co-operatives or start private businesses in a mass of trades and professions up to now reserved to the state.

"China is an example. No other country has lifted so many people out of poverty. This is something of which the Chinese people and government should be proud, and which the rest of the world admires," official daily Granma said in October 2009, echoing Fidel's words. Like China, or more likely Vietnam, the island will remain a one-party state.

"To renounce the principle of only one party would simply mean legalising the party or parties of imperialism on Cuban soil and sacrifice the strategic weapon of one party," Raul declared last Sunday. The president added that he would be merciless in punishing corruption, especially if the culprits were party members.

Next month the Pope, Benedict XVI, arrives on the island at the end of an unprecedented religious act. In 2010 Raul allowed the public veneration of a statue of the Virgin of Charity, the island's patroness, which was driven for 425 days from one end of Cuba to the other on top of a van.

Oil, mass tourism, private enterprise, broadband internet, organised religion – the brakes are coming off a society which today looks less towards Marx and Lenin and more toward its native-born 19th century hero, José Martí, who died in the battle for Cuban independence from Spain in 1895. God alone knows what's coming next.

Investigators said Officer Lisa J. Mearkle shot 59-year-old David Kassick in the back twice during the incident last month. The encounter began when Mearkle tried to pull Kassick over for expired emissions and inspection stickers, only for him to speed off.

When the officer caught up to Kassick near his sister’s house, he left his car and tried to escape on foot. Mearkle then used her Taser on Kassick. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico said footage recorded by the officer’s weapon appears to show Kassick trying to take the weapon’s probes out of his back before she shot him.

The arrest affadavit states, “At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow covered lawn with his face toward the ground. Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick’s hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.”

Mearkle, a 15-year veteran of her department, has argued that she thought Kassick was reaching into his jacket for a gun.

The Harrisburg Patriot-News reported that Mearkle was released from jail on Tuesday on $250,000 bail. Her next court appearance is set for April 20. She is currently charged with criminal homicide, but could face more specific charges as her case continues.





The suspect’s attorney, Brian Perry, said at a press conference that Kassick refused to comply with her instructions, and that she “did what she felt she had to do” because she had no way of knowing that he was not reaching for a weapon at the time of his death.

No weapons were found at the scene, but a syringe was found under Kassick’s body. Attorneys for his family said in a statement that he battled addiction problems.

“Mr. Kassick is now dead as a result of a traffic stop, a routine traffic stop,” said one of the attorneys, Christopher Slusser. “He should not be dead. He should not have died as a result of that traffic stop. And the manner in which he was shot — you can infer from that what you will.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0000837-d1ace2b81029ca5ea72d5808ac4f2f62.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010070 00000000000 015227  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Since Microsoft's surprising January reveal of the HoloLens, the company has been on an 11-city nationwide roadshow to recruit developers to write apps for the augmented reality platform. Now, Redmond has a HoloLens demo area for developers at its flagship Manhattan store, and I checked out the latest prototype.

The product has come a long way from the cable-strewn prototype I strapped on nearly a year ago. Units are now wireless and a heck of a lot easier to put on, but ultimately it is Microsoft's fully realized vision of a mixed reality environment that truly impresses.

Before I could enjoy HoloLens, I needed to get my Interpupillary Distance (IPD) measured, which is basically the distance between your eyes. This determines the lens separation required to create appropriately holographic images. It's no biggie; it took about 10 seconds. Then it was time to strap in.

The HoloLens looks like it could be a final product—a little more complicated than low-end VR kits like the Samsung Gear VR, but not terribly so. The lenses fit over your face like a pair of ski goggles, and two straps hold the HoloLens to your head. I kept trying to wear them like glasses on the bridge of my nose, but the proper placement is to have the lenses floating an inch or two above your nose. I can't say exactly how much the device weighs, but it isn't like wearing Google Glass. You will feel it, although it is more balanced and less obtrusive than the Oculus Rift. And yes, you can wear them over your regular glasses if you need them.

The important thing to understand with the HoloLens is that you can still see what is around you; this is an augmented, not a virtual, environment. The device creates holographic projections that are overlayed on a table, a wall, or the ceiling. You can even dock projections to your body. Feel like walking down the street with a Skype window hanging in the air? Go for it.

Microsoft showed me three new HoloLens experiences. Although I saw the HoloStudio in action earlier this year, it was only as an observer. This time, I was able to create a hologram and manipulate it in space. I created an object and walked around it, changing colors and adding details. When I was done, I had the option of exporting my design as a file or sending it directly to a 3D printer. It's relatively rudimentary, but you can see why companies like Autodesk have already signed up to use the platform.

Microsoft also showed HoloLens used as an augmented storytelling tool. Instead of creating a glossy one-sheet on a new watch, HoloLens was able to show the watch in 3D, simulate the internal gears, even replicate the ticking sound. This demo also showed how the HoloLens could be used to map out a model of the solar system that lets you stand inside the virtual model. The change in perspective is revealing. For example, I had never really noticed how dramatically off-axis Pluto's orbit is until I saw it through the HoloLens.

Finally, the coolest HoloLens demo was Project X-Ray. I don't want to take anything away from the Minecraft demo I saw this summer, but that's pretty tame in comparison. With X-Ray, the room you are in is under attack by alien robots. They attack from all sides, so you constantly have to spin around to track and shoot them. I wasn't doing too well until my guide told me I could dodge their attacks. After that, it was a game experience unlike anything I had ever tried.

It is important to note that I played X-Ray with HoloLens and a standard Xbox controller. That is because fundamentally, HoloLens is just a Windows 10 PC, albeit one you wear on your head with a room-sensing IR blaster and a holographic display built in. It is hard for people to get excited about laptops and desktops these days, but HoloLens is a Windows 10 device as well.

No one at Microsoft will say when HoloLens will be ready for consumers (a $3,000 developer version arrives next year), but the product works now. It is already being used by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) for research on Mars explorations. Case Western Reserve University is also using it to teach anatomy to medical students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000921-1ee66d869696d7873513a74ff9082e40.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011121 00000000000 014633  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Crown prosecution is seeking an eight-to-10-year sentence. Defense lawyer Peter Brauti, on the other hand, argued that imprisonment in this case would "serve no real purpose other than denunciation," and is asking for a sentence of two years less a day, to be served in the community — meaning Forcillo wouldn't see jail time.

On Wednesday, a hearing to determine what punishment fits the crime kicked off in a downtown Toronto courthouse.

Following a lengthy trial, Forcillo was found not guilty for second-degree murder but guilty of attempted murder in January. He had fired two volleys of shots at the knife-wielding teenager, who refused to obey his commands to drop the knife. Yatim sustained fatal injuries during the first volley of shots, but the second volley is the one for which Forcillo was convicted.

It's been a long, emotionally draining journey for Sahar Bahadi, whose son Sammy Yatim was killed by Toronto police officer James Forcillo on an empty streetcar in the summer of 2013.

A blunt exchange on what her son's life could've been had he survived a fatal shooting by a police officer was too much for a mother, who walked out of the cop's sentencing hearing, hysterical.

A blunt exchange on what her son's life could've been had he survived a fatal shooting by a police officer was too much for a mother, who walked out of the cop's sentencing hearing, hysterical.

It's been a long, emotionally draining journey for Sahar Bahadi, whose son Sammy Yatim was killed by Toronto police officer James Forcillo on an empty streetcar in the summer of 2013.

Following a lengthy trial, Forcillo was found not guilty for second-degree murder but guilty of attempted murder in January. He had fired two volleys of shots at the knife-wielding teenager, who refused to obey his commands to drop the knife. Yatim sustained fatal injuries during the first volley of shots, but the second volley is the one for which Forcillo was convicted.

On Wednesday, a hearing to determine what punishment fits the crime kicked off in a downtown Toronto courthouse.

The Crown prosecution is seeking an eight-to-10-year sentence. Defense lawyer Peter Brauti, on the other hand, argued that imprisonment in this case would "serve no real purpose other than denunciation," and is asking for a sentence of two years less a day, to be served in the community — meaning Forcillo wouldn't see jail time.

The defense is also expected to challenge the mandatory four or five-year minimum sentence for attempted murder and argue that the relevant sections in the Criminal Code are unconstitutional.

Presenting what the judge should accept as facts that led to Forcillo being found guilty, Brauti was met with resistance from Justice Edward Then, who took issue with, among other things, what he saw as Brauti asking him to take Forcillo's version of events as fact.

The morning took an emotional turn during one exchange between Brauti and Then, which resulted in Yatim's mother walking out in tears.

Towards the end of his submission on the facts, Brauti argued that because the first volley of shots left Yatim paralyzed, he wouldn't have felt any discomfort from the second volley — the one for which he was found guilty.

"Are you suggesting that I should look at the bullet wounds as inconsequential?" asked Then.

"From an actual harm perspective, we know that [the second volley] doesn't cause death, accelerate the death, affect his health or cause discomfort," Brauti responded.

"It's not as if no harm had happened," said Then, who appeared bewildered and irritated at many points throughout the defense's submissions. "There was substantial harm to Sammy Yatim. The only wrinkle is by the grace of God he had been rendered a quadriplegic by the preceding bullets."

'This is as low harm as it gets, other than the bullets missing him.'

"This is as low harm as it gets, other than the bullets missing him," said Brauti, adding that while a quadriplegic lives with serious trauma, Yatim was able to avoid that.

It was at this point that Bahadi walked out, accompanied by a victim's services staff member, breaking into audible cries as she got to the door. The cries turned to screams, that could be heard from inside the courtroom for several minutes.

Bahadi was sitting on a chair, being comforted by staff when court broke for recess. She returned after break, eyes red, taking her seat in the gallery.

The film is in theaters June 2

(CNN) "Wonder Woman" may be a feminist icon, but some male moviegoers aren't happy about some scheduled women-only screenings of the film.

The controversy began when the famous Alamo Drafthouse cinema in Austin, Texas, announced it would be hosting a screening of the new movie, which stars Gal Gadot as the superhero.

"Apologies, gentlemen, but we're embracing our girl power and saying 'No Guys Allowed' for one special night at the Alamo Ritz," the announcement read. "And when we say 'People Who Identify As Women Only,' we mean it. Everyone working at this screening -- venue staff, projectionist, and culinary team -- will be female."

That didn't go over well with some men, judging by the comments on the theater's Facebook page.

"Apparently 'equality' is only selective nowadays," one person wrote. "How about a 'men's only' showing of a movie or is that not how equality works?"

Syrian forces beat up a prominent Syrian political cartoonist and left him bleeding on the side of a road, in the latest episode of a campaign to quash dissent against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

Ali Ferzat, 60, is one of the Arab world's most famous cultural figures, and his drawings have pushed at the boundaries of freedom of expression in Syria.

The attack on Ferzat came as the Iranian leader, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, called for a dialogue between Assad and the opposition to bring a peaceful end to the protests.

Working from a gallery in central Damascus, Ferzat has long criticised the bureaucracy and corruption of the Syrian and other Arab regimes – earning him a death threat from former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Since March he has turned to depicting the uprising.

In the early hours of Thursday, masked men seized Ferzat from the street and forced him in to a van. A relative has said that Ferzat's attackers targeted his hands, breaking them both, and told him it was "just a warning" before leaving him by the roadside with a bag over his head.

In a galvanising moment similar to when the corpse of 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb was returned to his parents bearing marks of severe torture in May, Syrians have been expressing outrage. Messages have circulated online and some Facebook users changed their profile picture to a photograph of Ferzat in hospital.

The dissident artist, who once described himself as having a friendship with Assad, warned in 2007 of an impending "monumental crisis" if the regime did not reform. He has since become increasingly critical of the regime and its brutal crackdown.

In a recent cartoon he criticised the regime's offers of reforms, with a picture of an official with rosebuds in his speech bubble – and a turd in his head.

Another cartoon showed Assad hurriedly painting railway tracks to escape from a fast-approaching train. His most recent picture showed Assad trying to hitch a lift with outgoing Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

Assad has shrugged off international condemnation and continues to use security forces and thugs to kill and arrest his opponents. Arrests and raids continued across the country on Thursday with at least five people shot dead across the country and tanks sent into al-Boukamal on the Iraqi border, activists said.

Until now Ahmadinejad has refused to intervene in Syria, a regional ally it fears losing should the Assad regime fall. But in a rare public statement about the uprising, he told a Lebanese TV station: "What happened in Libya is what the west wants to happen to Syria too ... for this reason the Syrian people and the government should be conscious and try to solve their problems together and do their reforms themselves."

At least 2,200 people have been killed since mid-March, says the UN. On Wednesday, the EU imposed sanctions against Iran's elite Quds Force, saying it is helping crush the revolt.

Outspoken cultural figures have in the past been able to get away with more criticism than others. But in recent weeks, several artists, writers and actors have been arrested.

Last month, Ibrahim al-Qashoush, the composer of a popular anti-regime song in Hama, was found dead with his vocal chords removed.

"At this stage, fame may be more of a danger than a protection because the regime does not want any prominent figure to come to the fore and provide a public face for the revolution," said Ammar Abdulhamid, a US-based dissident and son of Syrian actor Mona Wasif.

Ferzat was born in Hama, where a tank assault on the eve of Ramadan to reinstate government control prompted widespread outrage. A graduate of Damascus University's faculty of fine arts, his initial work in the 1970s appeared in state-run newspapers. By 1980 his cartoons were being published in the French newspaper Le Monde, earning global recognition, exhibitions and prizes.

In a 2001 interview with the Guardian, Ferzat recalled that before becoming president, Assad visited one of his exhibitions and said that some of the cartoons banned in Syria should have been published. He also published satirical paper al-Domar (Lamplighter), which ran from late 2000 until he was forced to close it in 2003.

We're saying goodbye to yet another Mobile World Congress, but we have a few days left to hang around the beautiful city of Barcelona. Filled with Gaudi's masterpieces and amazing architecture in general, it would serve as an excellent arena for camera shootouts and we just couldn't miss this opportunity. We left the MWC with two great flagship devices each with a dual camera setup of its own - the LG G6 and the Huawei P10 - and we've decided to put them to a real-life test in the streets of Barcelona.

The Huawei P10 is seeing the return of the second-generation Leica setup, which premiered first with the Mate 9. It's a creative combination between a 12MP color and a 20MP monochrome sensor, with optical image stabilization and f/2.2 lens.

Huawei P10 camera at a glance:

Camera: 12MP OIS color + 20MP black & white, 4K video capture, Leica branding

12MP OIS color + 20MP black & white, 4K video capture, Leica branding Camera features: F/2.2 lens, Hybrid Zoom (2x magnification), OIS, can change focus and lighting in photos after they are taken, Variable Aperture, Portrait Mode

F/2.2 lens, Hybrid Zoom (2x magnification), OIS, can change focus and lighting in photos after they are taken, Variable Aperture, Portrait Mode Selfie cam: 8MP, f/1.9 Leica lens, Portrait Mode with live bokeh effects

LG G6 has a different take on the dual-camera experience, first established by the LG G5. The G6 has a 13MP regular 4:3 and optically stabilized camera with f/1.8 lens and a wide-angle 13MP fixed focus snapper with f/2.4.

LG G6 camera at a glance:

Main camera: 13MP f/1.8 primary camera with 71° field of view, OIS.

13MP f/1.8 primary camera with 71° field of view, OIS. Second main camera: 13MP f/2.4 wide-angle camera with 125° FOV, no OIS.

13MP f/2.4 wide-angle camera with 125° FOV, no OIS. Camera features: 1.12µm pixel size on both. 2160p/30fps video recording on both

But which of these monsters is better for sightseeing? Is it better to have a wide-angle camera or a monochrome one to spicy up your regular photos? Let's find out, shall we?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0000936-8ff49a6b83d6a6323c3c80890bbfaa9f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003523 00000000000 015262  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Twitter has launched a new alert system, for some organizations.

Twitter has become an importance resource for updates on what’s happening during crisis situations, and the company is now trying to make it easier for officials to share critical information when it matters most.

The company’s alerts site went live Tuesday and is available to government organizations at all levels — local, national and international — as well as some national agencies and organizations such as the World Health Organization or American Red Cross, which have been active on the network in past crises.

Users who have signed up for the alerts from those accounts will receive push notifications or text messages on their phones. Alert messages will have a different look in users’ Twitter streams.

The alerts, Twitter said, are meant for “crisis, disaster and emergency communications” that those enrolled in the program want to send to Twitter followers. Examples include natural disasters and severe weather, explosions, food or agricultural incidents and terrorism incidents, the network said.

Organizations must apply for participation in the program, Twitter said. Once approved, they must increase the security on their Twitter accounts, presumably to discourage hackers from being able to spam users’ phones.

Right now, organizations will only be able to send a limited number of alerts every hour, though they may continue to send normal tweets as usual, Twitter said.

The Twitter alerts differ from the emergency weather and AMBER alert messages that users can already opt to receive on their phones. Those alerts are issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Communications Commission.                                                                                                                                                                             0000935-bd58cccf4892e2617f6f620645180dfc.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005250 00000000000 015122  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Seventeen people were killed in Iraq on Monday in clashes between Islamic State militants and pro-government forces in a town close to the country’s biggest refinery, a focal point in efforts to counter the ultra-hardline Sunni group.

The refinery beside the town of Baiji has changed hands before, reflecting the Iraqi army’s struggle to hold territory it recaptures after months of clashes.

Fighting on Monday took place on a road used by Islamic State for supply lines leading from Baiji to the nearby town of Siniya to the west.

Twelve militants, two government soldiers and three members of Shi’ite militias that provide vital support for the army were killed, a senior regional security official said.

Siniya is held by Islamic State, which controls a third of Iraq, as well as parts of neighboring Syria.

The group, which also holds territory in Libya and has sympathizers in Egypt, highlights the spread of Islamist militancy since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled veteran autocrats who had repressed hardline groups.

Iraq’s government hoped to gain momentum after the army and its Shi’ite militia allies seized back Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit in April following a month-long battle.

But the Shi’ite-led government faced a setback last month when the insurgents captured Ramadi, provincial capital of Anbar Province, the country’s Sunni heartland.

Iraq’s army, which has largely proven ineffective against the insurgents, relies heavily on Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias as well as on U.S.-led air strikes to try to slow the momentum of Islamic State.

The group has used executions, sometimes videotaped, to strike fear into residents of areas it captures to try to sustain a self-proclaimed caliphate.

Islamic State’s territorial advances have exacerbated a sectarian conflict in Iraq, which is still struggling to find stability four years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

Iraq’s civil war has generated steady allegations of human rights abuses on all sides, as well as concerns over a humanitarian crisis.

In a speech on Monday in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al-Hussein accused Islamic State of perpetrating “the most despicable abuses on the Iraqi people under its control”.

“Countering extremism and addressing sectarian violence will require more than military action,” he said.

“We stand ready to assist the government to promote the rule of law and good governance; increase accountability; encourage community reconciliation; and ensure respect for the rights of minorities and of women.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000820-2a81d76b25c7235cd8fb3e6ef9b2b8f8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003545 00000000000 015262  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Not every comic gets the opportunity to reinvent himself. For Roy Haylock, that chance came a year ago when he won the sixth season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a coup that propelled the scathingly funny standup from cabaret act to arena superstar, selling out venues all over the country on his hit “Rolodex of Hate” tour.

But the real change occurred 19 years earlier when New Orleans-raised Haylock, the son of a Cuban mother and Honduran father, was reborn onstage as Bianca Del Rio: big hair, heavy makeup, major attitude — which Haylock describes as “a cross between Bozo and Joan Crawford,” only funnier.

“All those years of having a microphone in a bar full of drunk people gave me a chance to build my act,” he says. Recently relocated to Los Angeles, Haylock has hours of material (he’s prepping a second tour) but doesn’t write jokes the way other comedians do. Instead, he has filled a Rolodex with cues designed to trigger various withering rants.

“I do enjoy a live audience. They give me 90% of the material just by looking at them,” says Haylock, whose caustic off-the-cuff style earned him a valuable fan: Joan Rivers. The icon not only invited Haylock to appear on “In Bed With Joan” (which became the Web series’ second most-watched episode), but also connected him with “her people” shortly before her death, sparking several possible TV and book projects.

And now Haylock is bringing Bianca to the bigscreen in his crowdsourced indie feature “Hurricane Bianca”: Filmed in Texas, it tells of a school teacher who loses his job for being gay, but comes back as Bianca Del Rio.

The president of an ‘ex-gay’ group has said gays will go to heaven as long as they have ‘security in Christ’.

Head of Exodus International Alan Chambers recently admitted curing someone of their sexuality is impossible, drawing concerns from far right Christian organizations.

He says if anyone has given their heart to Christ, ‘salvation is inevitable’.

Chambers said: ‘The point that I’m trying to make is that we as believers can have security in Christ when we are believers.

‘I’m not saying that sin isn’t sin. I’m not saying that people should live in unrepentant sin. I’m not saying that that’s a mark of a mature believer at all.’

Several religious leaders are urging the 40-year-old, who recently admitted he still felt ‘homosexual urges, to resign as president of the US’s most prominent ex-gay organization.

Doctor A.J. Gagnon, associate professor of New Testament at Pittsburg Theological Seminary, told Christian Post Chambers is making a mockery of Exodus International.

He said: ‘The issue is Alan assures even self-professed believers who are unrepentant and self-affirming in their sin that no sinning of any magnitude or degree will keep them going to heaven.’

Chambers said even though he has surrendered his life to Jesus Christ, everyone is a victim of sin.

He told the website he is frustrated with Christians who put greater emphasis on being gay than other issues, and says all sins are equal.

He said: ‘For other people who are involved in unrepentant sin whether it’s the sin of homosexual sexual expression or gluttony or pride or heterosexual sexual expression outside of a monogamous heterosexual marriage or any other – are those people in danger of losing their salvation over those issues?

‘Would Gagnon and other people make as big a deal about that as they are with this? I don’t think so.’

Last year the organization’s former Executive Director, John Smid, came out as gay declaring, ‘One cannot repent of something that is unchangeable.’

Exodus International’s founder, Michael Bussee, also famously left the organization to begin a long term relationship with another senior office holder in the group, Gary Cooper. The couple spent the rest of Cooper’s life together before his death from AIDs in 1991.                                                                                                                               0000963-3c269db7bb108af5a1175ce4422c3ea3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011611 00000000000 015143  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Washington (CNN) -- Most would not consider civil rights the top concern of the nation's spies, but it was standing room only this week as hundreds gathered in the Central Intelligence Agency auditorium attentively listening to speeches on the civil rights movement.

Even the CIA commemorates the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. It was one of several agencies remembering the civil rights hero in advance of the federal King holiday on Monday.

Director Leon Panetta told the intelligence officers it is just as important today that all Americans follow the message of King, that "unless we provide equality to all, regardless of race, regardless of color or creed or gender or disability or sexual orientation, that none of us truly can be free."

Panetta called on everyone to rededicate themselves to the American dream King fought and died for, "an America of, by and for all people."

Panetta recounted his own lifelong commitment to the civil rights movement, from his days on Capitol Hill working on landmark civil rights legislation, to his service as the director of the U.S. Civil Rights office, to his time as President Clinton's chief of staff trying to protect affirmative action.

The CIA director then introduced the guest of honor, Nikki Giovanni, an acclaimed black poet and educator, whom he compared to King.

"It is very fitting that we celebrate the life of Dr. King -- a great orator, poet, activist, teacher and leader -- with words of wisdom from another great orator, poet, activist, teacher and leader," Panetta said.

Giovanni took the stage and immediately grabbed the attention of her audience by proclaiming, "I'm a big fan of slavery." While acknowledging slavery is bad, Giovanni said black Americans have an incredible history, having come through the period of slavery with their sanity intact.

"Every day I wake up and say I'm so damn glad I'm black," Giovanni said.

With passion and humor, Giovanni then explored a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement that didn't focus on King, but rather on Rosa Parks, the black woman whose refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus in 1955 brought the national spotlight on the injustice of segregation and led to a change in the law.

"I'm a big fan of Martin, but ... where would Martin be without Rosa?" said the longtime Virginia Tech professor, who wants to see December 1 designated as Rosa Parks Day.

Giovanni, who was a friend of Parks for more than 20 years, shared her impressions and some personal stories about the civil rights icon.

She described Parks as a positive person with a sense of humor, always polite, a real Southern woman. She said Parks had an incredibly soft voice which just seemed to carry. She recalled a phone conversation with Parks about a sentence she wrote in "Rosa," a children's book chronicling the bus standoff. Parks told her she liked the book, but questioned Giovanni's characterization of her as having "fiddled for a dime," a reference to Parks' trying to find 10 cents to pay the bus driver.

"I've never fiddled in my life," said Parks, to which Giovanni responded, "Mrs. Parks, you're going to fiddle in my book."

She marveled at Parks' calm as she waited for police to come arrest her, her refusal of the officers' suggestion that she give up her seat on the bus.

Giovanni said she told Parks it was good it was her, because if she had been in that position, "I would have said, 'Do I look like your mama's sister?' I would have had to say something. Then they would have had to hit me. Then someone would have said 'don't hit Nikki.' Then someone else would have pulled out a gun. It would have changed -- totally different.

"Fortunately, it was Mrs. Parks."

Giovanni said Parks was a private person who kept her cards incredibly close. "She wouldn't be on Oprah talking about what she does and doesn't do," Giovanni joked.

She also referred to Parks as a beautiful woman and suggested actress Halle Berry would be a good choice to portray her.

Giovanni interspersed her remarks at the CIA with a spirited defense of black men.

She believed Raymond Parks, Rosa's husband, got a bad rap for excessive drinking. "Raymond didn't start drinking too much until someone started trying to kill his wife," Giovanni said, adding, "I get sick of people for picking on black men, because they are just people who are responding to things that are happening to them."

She maintained black men could never have started the Montgomery bus boycott that followed the arrest of Rosa Parks, because something "ugly" would have happened.

But she also is convinced the men were in a more difficult position than the women. They had to "go home and pray their wives would be OK -- had to be the most difficult time in a black man's life."

Giovanni marveled at the ingenuity of the black maids who, when asked by the white people they worked for if they supported the bus boycott, would respond, "No ma'am, and I'm staying off those buses until this trouble is over."                                                                                                                       0000855-b41db2d55298afed3e278db0a2795312.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001672 00000000000 015107  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        About the Groundhog

The groundhog, or woodchuck, is one of 14 species of marmots. These rodents live a feast-or-famine lifestyle and gorge themselves all summer to build up plentiful reserves of fat. After the first frost, they retreat to their underground burrows and snooze until spring, drawing their sustenance from body fat. While hibernating, the animal's heart rate plunges, and its body temperature is not much warmer than the temperature inside its burrow.

Groundhog Day and Hibernation

Groundhog hibernation gave rise to the popular American custom of Groundhog Day, held on the second of February every year. Tradition dictates that if a groundhog sees its shadow that day, there will be six more weeks of winter, though such a prediction seems a sure bet over much of the groundhog's North American range.

In the spring, females welcome a litter of perhaps a half dozen newborns, which stay with their mother for several months.

McKinney Police Corporal Eric Casebolt, who is white, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation of how he appeared to target black youths at the disturbance on Friday in the city about 30 miles (50 km) north of Dallas, an incident that has raised fresh questions about racial bias in U.S. policing.

“He came into the call out of control and as the video shows was out of control during the incident,” McKinney Police Chief Greg Conley told a news conference. Casebolt tendered his resignation on his own, Conley added.

In the video, Casebolt is seen shouting obscenities at black youths in a multiracial crowd, shoving an African-American teenage girl, briefly pointing his gun at black youths and throwing the black 15-year-old girl in her bathing suit to the ground, putting his knees on her back.

“I had 12 officers on the scene, and 11 of them performed according to their training. They did an excellent job,” Conley said.

The seven-minute video, viewed 9 million times on YouTube as of Tuesday morning, shows officers responding to the incident, which police said started when scores of young people attended a party with a disc jockey at a community pool and refused requests to leave.

Casebolt, a 10-year veteran once named the department’s patrolman of the year, was questioned by authorities on Monday. He has not spoken publicly about the incident.

The role of race has divided the fast-growing city of about 150,000, which has attracted young families seeking affordable and spacious housing, good schools and a sharply lower crime rate than in Dallas.

In 2014, McKinney was ranked number one in Money magazine’s annual ranking of the Best Places to Live in America. It had a median household income of $80,000 in 2012.

For some, Casebolt’s actions in targeting African-Americans, who make up about 10 percent of McKinney’s population, pointed to bias, while others said he acted properly in helping to break up a party that had gotten out of hand and blame the teenagers for not obeying the police.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000945-1ffe66ea97639b363238bb3e863dbf25.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012167 00000000000 015134  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Supreme Court reacted on scanning the figures of vehicular deaths over the years.

The year 2014 alone witnessed 2.37 lakh road accidents on national and state highways across the country which had left at least 85,462 people dead and 2.59 lakh injured.

These were the sensational findings in official statistics placed before the Supreme Court, which noted that as per 2009 data, India had reported the highest number of road accident fatalities in the world which clearly indicated that a road accident occurred every four minutes.

India can avoid the tag of being the "accident capital of the world", was how the top court reacted on scanning the figures of vehicular deaths over the past several years while stressing on the need for "proper enforcement" of law preventing drunken driving.

The Supreme Court said proper enforcement of law was needed for a nation like India, which is on the cusp of economic development, to protect precious human lives from road mishaps specially due to drunken driving.

The remarks were made by the top court in its December 15 judgement by which it ordered a ban on all liquor shops on national and state highways across the country while making it clear that licenses of the existing shops will not be renewed after March 31 next year.

"Human life is precious. As the road network expands in India, road infrastructure being an integral part of economic development, accidents profoundly impact on the life of common citizen. For a nation on the cusp of economic development, India can well avoid the tag of being the accident capital of the world," a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur said.

The bench, also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, took note of the statistics placed before it by the government agencies, according to which total number of persons killed in road accidents on the national highways was 48,768 in 2012 which shot up to 51,204 in 2015.

In 2014, there were 1.24 lakh accident cases resulting in 46,110 deaths and 1.35 lakh persons injured in mishaps on the national highways while on state highways, the figure was 1.13 lakh accidents in which 1.24 lakh people were injured and 39,352 had been killed.

"The expressways witnessed 4,208 accident cases, 4,229 injured and 1,802 deaths. Figures are also available of the distribution of road accidents by causes during 2014. 1.38 lakh persons were injured in road accidents involving dangerous or careless driving and 42,127 deaths occurred.

"Injuries caused in accidents due to over-speeding stood at 1.81 lakh while there were 48,654 deaths. 7,307 accident cases involving driving under the influence of drugs/alcohol were registered resulting in 7,398 injuries and 2,591 deaths," the bench noted in its order.

The top court further said that on December 1, 2011, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, in an advisory issued to Chief Secretaries of all the States and Union Territories, had noted that India had reported the highest number of road accident fatalities in the world and data of 2009 indicated that a road accident occurred every four minutes.

It said that in the advisory, it was said that drunken driving was a "leading cause" of road accidents as 27,152 road accidents was caused under the influence of alcohol in 2009.

The bench said that in another advisory of March 18, 2013, the ministry had stated that in 2011, 1.42 lakh people were killed in 4.9 lakhs road accidents and 24,655 accidents were caused due to drunken driving resulting in 10,553 deaths and injuries to 21,148 persons.

Referring to another advisory of May 2014, the top court said that in 2012, 1.38 lakh people were killed in 4.9 lakh road accidents out of which 23,979 accidents were caused due to drunken driving resulting in 7835 deaths and injuries to 23,403 persons.

The bench observed that availability of liquor along the highways is an "opportunity to consume" and there are alarming statistics on the occurrence of road accidents which have claimed human lives and caused debility and injury.

"The figures which are available on the record indicate that the occurrence of a large number of road accidents is neither a phenomenon confined to national highways nor is prevalence of road accidents, including fatalities, confined only to the national highways.

"Both the national highways and state highways share a common experience of an unacceptably high number of road accidents, the prevalence injuries and fatalities; drunken driving being one of the major causes," it said.

The bench observed that highways and expressways provides seamless connectivity and unheralded opportunities for growth of trade and industry and for the movement of goods, persons and capital and are the backbone of the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by Article 301 of the Constitution.

"Our highways are dotted with sign boards warning of the dangers of combining speed and alcohol. Together, they constitute a heady cocktail. The availability of liquor along the highways is an opportunity to consume.

"Easy access to liquor shops allows for drivers of vehicles to partake in alcohol, in callous disregard to their own safety and the safety of others," the top court said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0000947-9d0ef49800f0dcee7b3c17358ee6bda1.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014202 00000000000 015330  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Charter school advocates push enrollment shift in Oakland

Deep-pocketed education reformers have set their sights on Oakland, where they are pushing changes to the school assignment system used by parents that would include charter schools as well as the district’s traditional public schools.

Advocates for school choice and charters — including the New Schools Venture Fund and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation — have supported similar common enrollment systems in Denver, New Orleans and most recently in Boston.

But Oakland would become the first in California to bring charter schools into the school assignment process, even though the charters essentially compete with the district for students.

Superintendent Antwan Wilson wants this kind of one-stop shopping to help families find the best public school — traditional or charter — for their children. It’s not about politics, officials said.

“It is our obligation to the public to create a level playing field so that parents can have access to these schools,” said district spokesman Troy Flint. “It’s not about the district. It’s about what we can do for families to give them a better educational fit for their child.”

A common enrollment system would provide parents with a range of information on all Oakland public schools and then allow parents to list their top choices. At district schools, siblings of students already enrolled in a school, and those living in the school’s neighborhood, would continue to get top priority.

Charters would be able to set their own priorities, as allowed under the law.

While a formal resolution and vote isn’t expected until January, the school board is scheduled to hold a study session Wednesday, the first opportunity it has had to review and address the idea.

Critics have spoken at several community meetings, including one Monday night, saying they are concerned that common enrollment would mean using district funds to market charter schools to prospective families.

The district needs to fix an antiquated enrollment system and promote district schools first, said Oakland school board member Roseann Torres at the meeting.

“Doing this together is completely nonsensical,” she said. “Why should I advertise for the other guy?”

The current proposal heading to the board includes a broad overhaul of the student assignment system, improving technology and adding staffing and other resources to ensure parents can access — in several languages — the system online, at every school and at satellite enrollment centers across the city.

But those improvements are a package deal. The foundation funding that would pay for the estimated $1.2 million in upgrades is contingent on the inclusion of charter schools in the process, Flint said.

The common enrollment effort is supported by Oakland’s Educate 78, a nonprofit group focused on increasing access to quality schools, including the creation of new charter schools.

The organization, funded by charter advocates including Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, New Schools Venture Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies, has covered the $300,000 in costs associated with the development of the proposal and initial public outreach, including consultants and community meetings.

Superintendent Wilson, a former Denver district official, proposed the common enrollment system to streamline a complicated and unpredictable system that requires families to fill out separate enrollment forms for the district and each charter school.

Sometimes students get into a district school and charters, showing up to one and leaving an unexpected empty seat elsewhere.

In addition, the superintendent believes having charter schools in the enrollment process will prevent the charters from gaming the system, enrolling a lower proportion of English learners, students with special needs or other high-need students than district schools.

While charter schools are public schools, they operate under a different set of rules. They have their own governing boards and can adopt their own policies related to instruction, staffing, discipline and expulsion.

They are required by the state to use a random student enrollment process, yet charters serve fewer special education students, especially those with the most severe disabilities, as well as fewer English learners.

In Oakland, about 11,000 students attend one of the city’s 44 charters.

Across the country, the idea of common enrollment is coming from market-driven reform groups, which believe that parental choice and competition for students will force low-performing and under-enrolled schools to innovate and improve.

That’s a bad idea, said Kim Davis, co-founder of OUSD Parents United, which advocates increased community involvement in city schools.

“We need to give our public schools the support, leadership and resources they need to become great, not throw them into competition with well-resourced charters and let them duke it out,” she said.

Charter schools would not be required to participate in the district’s common enrollment process. District officials, however, believe most will eventually sign up.

District officials said a survey conducted in October found that 73 percent of parents want one application for all Oakland public schools.

“Parents don’t care whether the school is a charter or traditional public school,” said school board President James Harris. “They don’t really care. They want a system that works.”

Two scenes from Mexico, where my family just spent a week’s vacation. (Skip the envy. Nice weather, yes, but my husband slipped before we left and spent the whole time on crutches. Meantime, this was the general tenor of our kids’ conversation: “I just saw a stingray.” “No you didn’t.” “I did too!” “You just think you did.” “But I did!” “See?”)

Anyway, that’s not the point — thank God. The point is to contrast two scenes. The first, in town: A Mexican boy of about 8, sweeping his home. Not its floor. Its roof. With no guardrails.

Scene two, at the resort: Our own boys, 10 and 12, renting snorkeling gear: Mask, flippers, life jacket.

Even a few years back, my sister informs me, snorkelers did not wear life jackets. Now these are standard issue, at least for kids.

I was very happy the boys got them, since I am, at heart, a chicken. But if these jackets didn’t automatically come as part of the package, I wouldn’t have missed them, either. Just like most of us would not miss the safety belts that now come standard in toy wagons. Or the arm straps that now come standard in strollers, so you can plaster your kid to the seat as if you’re on your way to a typhoon, rather than the park — where, by the way, there’s a spring under the teeter-totter so no one lands too hard, and the slide is short, so no one falls too far, and the ground is springy, just in case someone does.

Did I mention the fact that the swing chains’ holes have been filled in so no one catches a finger in them? On some playgrounds, that’s the case.

As we pile on the safety precautions and equipment, the expectation of zero danger becomes the norm. What seemed a reasonable risk even a year or two ago now seems foolhardy. Snorkeling without a life vest becomes a quaint memory, on par with putting your baby to sleep in a room without a sound monitor. Sure that seemed fine – until those monitors came along. After that, putting your baby to sleep without one sounded positively rash.

Then along came video monitors. Full color, flat screen ones that let you see and hear everything going on in the crib. At which point, putting your baby to bed with just a sound monitor sounded positively rash. (And don’t even ask about the infra-red cameras.)

Do children really need all this protection? It’s hard to say no, when all around us are the means to prevent our kids from encountering even the least likely catastrophe.

But the parents of the Mexican boy sweeping the railing-free roof are protecting their child another way – protecting him from feeling helpless and timid. Deliberately or not, they are raising a child who is confident in a scary place, or, if not confident, then at least forced to be brave, which is how confidence grows. He also looked pretty cheerful. And he’s good with a broom.

Those happen to be my exact goals for my own sons. So far?

Well, they’ve seen some giant sea turtles. And they’ve lived to tell the tale. But now that we’re back home, it may be time for another brand new experience.

It involves a dust pan.

The six men and women arrived at a market in the town of Rabba, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the capital Amman, when one of the vendors identified the tourists as Israeli due to mens’ skullcaps, which “provoked the sensibilities of the vendors,” independent daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm reported.

The vendor proceeded to assault the men with shoes, a symbol of disdain in Arab culture. The Israeli tourists fled the area in their cars as buyers joined the attack, the daily reported.

No information was reported on their condition or if they remained in Jordan.

“Israelis are not wanted in the market,” a shopper told Al-Arab Al-Yawm. “Those who talk about peace between Israelis and Jordanians are delusional. The signed agreements are nothing but ink on paper. They are meaningless.”

An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman told The Times of Israel he was unaware of the incident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000845-b04bcb95247115dadd1fb4af79220c79.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002316 00000000000 015154  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Current Features

Emma Zhou, 36, had just finished eating dim sum with her two little girls in North Beach’s Washington Square Park. It was a late afternoon in mid-August last year, the kind of Friday that lulls people into sunbathing on the grass. Zhou sat on a bench beneath the shade of a huge Canary Island pine watching the girls throw stale bread to the pigeons. The soft swish of the leaves overhead and the cadence of her children’s laughter was intoxicating.

It would be her last normal moment, the divide between then and now.

Zhou has no memory of the 100-pound pine limb snapping off its trunk, or of it crushing the bench she was sitting on. When officers arrived just after 3:10 p.m., they found her lying on the sidewalk screaming for help, her head in a halo of blood. Her 5- and 9-year-old daughters stood frozen. By the time medics took her vital signs and strapped her onto a gurney, she was unresponsive.

She awoke in a hospital room to a cacophony of chirping medical equipment. A piercing pain radiated up her spine and into her skull. Nurses in cranberry-colored scrubs adjusted the plastic cone around her neck. Her husband, mother-in-law and daughters, the oldest bandaged where the branch had scraped her back, peeked around the door frame. Opioids clouded Zhou’s understanding of the scene.

More than 10 months after the pine limb crushed her skull and severed her spinal cord, Zhou remains at Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in San Francisco.

She and her husband, Tony Tan, 46, have sued the city, claiming its care of the tree was negligent. As bills stack up and court proceedings grind forward, Zhou is trapped in a medical purgatory as her daughters begin to grow up without her.

She is paralyzed from the waist down and will never walk again, doctors say. It could have been anyone sitting under the tree in the park that day. But it is her life that has been permanently interrupted.

“I felt happy and satisfied easily,” she said of life before the accident, “and I felt grateful for everything. Now …,” her voice trails off.

This was not the life she and Tan envisioned when they emigrated from China. He came first, moving with his parents from Taishan in the southern Guangdong province to San Francisco in 1984 when he was 13. In 2002, a mutual friend introduced them. Zhou was living in Kaiping, a small city on the Pearl River Delta 45 minutes north of Tan’s hometown. They fell in love over trans-Pacific phone calls and married there in 2003. She moved to Northern California a year later.

The couple bought a two-bedroom home in San Pablo with a big backyard to grow Swiss chard, chives, bok choy, tomatoes and kale. They brought two cherubic-faced baby girls in pink knit hats home to that house. Tan got a job repairing electronics at Central Computers on Howard Street. Zhou took English language classes at City College and shuttled the girls to school. She cooked sticky rice and elaborate cakes decorated with strawberries sliced to look like blooming flowers.

Before she was a paraplegic, Zhou ran laps around their neighborhood every morning. She wanted to register for a race, maybe even a marathon, and feel the weight of a medal around her neck. She volunteered in her older daughter’s classroom. Someday, she hoped to work at a hair salon and would practice on her family, trimming her daughters’ bangs and shaving Tan’s sideburns.

Every Sunday, they went to Myoshinji Temple in Pinole. At first, Tan would nap in the car in the Buddhist shrine’s parking lot while Zhou attended services. But he was fascinated by the parishioners’ tranquillity, so he joined. It opened his heart, he said, and brought him newfound peace.

It was a simple life, an easy life, Tan said.

And then the tree branch fell.

In the days after the Aug. 12 accident, no one knew whom to blame. City officials trucked the branch to an outside arborist for an examination, searching for clues as to why it had snapped. Then they locked away the limb — now evidence — at an undisclosed location.

In November, Zhou and Tan filed a lawsuit against the city in San Francisco Superior Court seeking damages greater than $25,000 for negligence. Her hospital expenses are partly covered by health insurance, but it won’t be enough to cover a lifetime of medical dependency — those costs are not yet calculable. Until Friday, their GoFundMe campaign was more than $7,000 short of its $50,000 goal.

Their suit says the Canary Island pine had been “negligently pruned” in a way that “causes the rapid growth of large, heavy and weakly attached branches,” which can kill people. Her attorneys say that the city had received reports of falling tree branches in that same part of the park.

“The city knows that trees pruned like this must be watched closely and pruned frequently because they will continue to develop branches that are too heavy and large for the tree to support,” said attorney Jeremy Cloyd, who is representing Zhou and her family.

The tree whose branch struck Zhou had been trimmed through a tree topping method, the lawsuit says. The upper part of the 50-foot-tall tree was removed, allowing its lateral branches to grow rapidly.

Tree assessment records show that the city was slow to routinely inspect and maintain the pine trees near the Washington Square playground to industry standards, which call for pruning every 15 years.

The Recreation and Park Department says budget shortfalls have long impacted tree maintenance. Each of the 177,000 trees on the department’s land was scheduled to be serviced only once every 105 years as of 2010. But department officials say that $8 million in bond funding over the past seven years and $750,000 from the General Fund annually has helped speed tree maintenance.

Tree experts say Canary Island pines are typically stable compared with other trees. In a database run by the International Society of Arboriculture, only 24 of 6,026 tree failures since 1987 in California involved that species. Eight of the 24 Canary Island pine failures — when a trunk, branch or root breaks — in California involved broken limbs like the branch that hit Zhou.

But city arborists who examined the tree multiple times after the limb split off and hit Zhou maintain it is structurally sound. The tree was not trimmed using a tree-topping method, city officials say, and the branch falling was a fluke.

“We’re still gathering and assessing all of the information we can, but at the moment there is no indication that this was anything but an unforeseeable, freak accident,” said John Coté, a spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera. “This is a heartbreaking situation. At the same time, the city has a legal responsibility to all taxpayers that we must honor. We are doing everything we can to work in good faith with the plaintiffs.”

About 25 to 35 people are killed by falling trees or branches annually in the United States, said Tom Schmidlin, a professor in the Department of Geography at Kent State University, who studies and tracks tree-related storm deaths.

In 2008, a redwood limb in Stern Grove snapped, striking and killing a San Francisco woman as she loaded her dog into the back of a Subaru Outback. In January, a tree crushed a Ukiah home, killing a woman as she slept.

But Zhou lived.

“Before, I would never pay attention,” Zhou said in Cantonese through an interpreter. “Now every time I go under a tree, I think, is it going to fall?”

“Ten more minutes, Emma,” said Richard Sigua, a physical therapy aide at the rehabilitation center in the shadow of Twin Peaks.

Zhou’s eyes are fixed on a blinking plastic kitchen timer counting down the seconds. Her legs are strapped in a metal brace, and she stands tall and unassisted. Late February sun streams through the windows, alighting on the new strands of white in her hair. Across the gym, patients in wheelchairs circled an instructor teaching Zumba. They waved their hands to the beat of “The Macarena.”

Doctors are trying to slow the steady atrophy of the muscles Zhou once used to run, play basketball and to crouch to hug her daughters. They have her lift weights on a rickshaw — she started at 40 pounds and can now pull 60. She flexes her growing biceps after each set, proud of the newfound strength. Three times a week, she stands in a metal brace.

Zhou’s once-strong and lithe body has become the enemy: her quadriceps jumping with spasms, nerves misfiring, muscles atrophying and toes pointing in a perpetual ballerina’s tendu. Contractions ripple up to her stomach, the pain white-hot.

After the exercises, Zhou goes to the art room. She paints bluejays with moist pink worms dangling from their beaks and Mount Tamalpais shrouded in a layer of coastal fog. This is Zhou’s life now: a parade of doctor’s appointments, rehabilitation sessions and crafts, most contained within the hospital’s walls.

She knits teal scarves, paints and watches Korean soap operas on TV, the tedium the only thing she can count on. She looks out the window at the undulating grass. Robins chatter through the thick glass, and pigeons peck at the cement. She prays, reciting the same intention over and over: Let me walk. Let me walk again. Let me live outside of this wheelchair. Let me be the mother and wife I once was.

But there is no timeline for being discharged. And she can’t go home because her San Pablo house isn’t equipped for a woman in a wheelchair.

“I think about if my husband will despise me, or if he will leave me someday,” she said. “Before the accident happened, I was more confident. I felt happier and lived with my family without any worries. I felt blessed at that time. Before the accident, I was a more cheerful person.”

Her husband and daughters have moved in with his parents in the four-bedroom Visitacion Valley condominium where he grew up. Tan was once shot on the sidewalk out front during an attempted robbery. The bullet is still lodged in his left arm. He had moved to a safer neighborhood in the East Bay for his family. But after his wife was injured, he moved home so his parents could help with his daughters and to be closer to the hospital.

“Life takes you places,” Tan said. “Sometimes you can’t avoid it. It takes you back, even though you want to move on to a better place.”

He brings Chinese broccoli and catfish stew to Zhou, bottles of acrylic paint from Michael’s art supply and primary-colored helium balloons from their nephew’s first birthday party.

At night, Tan’s mind flashes back to the first X-ray and the sliver of black where there shouldn’t be: his wife’s spinal cord separated. When sleep won’t come, he reaches for his cell phone, searching for solutions: spinal surgeries in China, acupuncture techniques, stem cell research.

Tan buys a tan van with a handicap lift off Craigslist for $7,000 and a used wheelchair on eBay for $2,500. He learns to cook simple recipes in his mother’s kitchen — hard-boiled eggs and oatmeal — and shop for tiny jumpers and jackets for his daughters at discount department stores.

He has taken a leave of absence from work to be both parents for the girls. At night, they often wake up screaming or sleepwalk around the condo. For weeks after the accident, his younger daughter stopped talking.

Sometimes, he sits in Zhou’s room watching midday TV and flipping through the business cards he keeps in his pocket: city officials, doctors, social workers, marriage counselor, contractors, child therapists and physical therapists. They are the people who will try to equip his parents’ home — the couple’s San Pablo house has too many barriers — with wide hallways and long ramps for Zhou’s wheelchair, fix the trauma of what their daughters saw, fix their marriage. But they can’t fix everything.

“We’ll all be together,” Tan said, his voice cracking. “But it will never be normal again for her. I don’t understand why. If the tree was healthy, why did it drop down so fast? To me, it’s bad luck. Really, really bad luck.”

On an afternoon in early April, her daughters visit Zhou at Laguna Honda.

They walk alongside their mother’s wheelchair to the small farm on the hospital’s campus in search of the gray tabby that likes to sit in Zhou’s lap. The girls inspect the strawberry blossoms and the blooming Icelandic poppies. They fling water from a bucket into the sky, screaming. Their visits are few, twice a week, sometimes more during school breaks.

They stand taller than Zhou’s wheelchair now, more unfamiliar to her with each passing week. Their hair has grown longer; their fingernails are painted by someone else. Her older girl has started reading the Harry Potter series, the youngest has learned to brush her own teeth. Zhou thinks about them leaving her, the day they will no longer need their mother. She wonders if they even need her now.

It must be karma, Zhou decides, the lingering consequences from sinning in a past life. The tree branch, and everything that has come after, was never meant for anyone else. The vials of prescription pills, the dependency on strangers to change her diapers, a lifetime condemned to a wheelchair — all for her.

She has stopped asking why.

“The world is still a beautiful place,” her husband tells her. “You have your daughters. You could have been like the woman in Ukiah. She didn’t even have a chance. You’re lucky.”

“Maybe she was the lucky one,” Zhou replies.

Her sadness ebbs and grows. She cries for hours, not certain just why. In the first few months, she considered suicide, but not anymore. Now, she often doesn’t feel anything, she said.

Months after the accident, Zhou sketches in bed. Plastic packages of baby wipes, deodorizer and sharp-tipped colored pencils litter the bedside table. Trinkets from the friends she rarely sees and drawings of the shaded places she can no longer walk cover the walls.

Her calves, swollen in their compression socks, peek from under a blanket. She runs her fingers through her hair, hiding the thick white scar arcing along the curve of her skull. Ten months and still no end in sight.

In her drawing, Zhou sits facing a tree. The dark of her silhouette, face hidden, fades to the white of a sky brightened by sunshine. A ghost floats above the grass. Devils peer from the bushes.

“I’m trying to draw my own story and my own fear,” she said.

In her picture, the tree branch never falls.

A GoFundMe campaign to help Emma Zhou and her family remains short of its goal: www.gofundme.com/hitbytree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0000959-e6a757f4f9c31724794563581525eb4a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010052 00000000000 014633  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Harry Redknapp did his best to sound optimistic. The Tottenham Hotspur manager made the right noises about his team being so close to a top-four finish. He even suggested that they had thrown away a golden opportunity. The door has been pushed shut by Manchester City and it will be locked tight on Tuesday evening if Tottenham fail to win at Eastlands. Redknapp said that with a few clever tweaks his club could be back again to challenge next season.

Yet the devil on his other shoulder had plenty to say, too. And the scenario that it painted felt apocalyptic for a club such as Tottenham. "I know people in the right positions [at City], who have said: 'The one thing we couldn't offer was Champions League football,'" Redknapp said. "But they tell me that they've got one or two players signed already who'll blow your brains out. They're not going to stop until they win the championship and even the Champions League.

"They don't need the money. The man from Abu Dhabi has got so much money ... I mean, it isn't like money to him, is it? City can be a real force next year. They've got a strong squad which is only going to get better because they've got unlimited funds to buy anybody they want and they can pay the wages. They've got players there now earning £200,000 a week. It's crazy. It's another world."

Redknapp's mathematics were not overly stretched when he assessed the long-term make-up of the top four. "As I've said a million times, who is going to drop out?" he said. "I don't think Manchester United or Chelsea are going to ... Arsenal have been there every year. Who is going to come out? Man City are going to spend another £200m, probably, this summer, Liverpool are going to improve, so it's very hard to get into that top four ... very, very difficult."

Do not talk to Redknapp about where it has gone wrong for Tottenham. To him it has been another richly encouraging season, underpinned by exciting football. He is fond of pointing out that Tottenham have not exactly been perennial Champions League contenders in the past.

In terms of the demise of their top-four hopes – even if Tottenham win at City, they would remain big outsiders – Redknapp has his theories. They include the mental and physical demands of the club's Champions League debut; the strikers' lack of Premier League goals; the frustration in the January transfer window and the failure to see off the teams at the foot of the table.

But Redknapp feels that the key has been the inability of Gareth Bale and Rafael van der Vaart to maintain their sparkling form from the first part of the season. Bale will now miss the final three matches with the ankle-ligament injury he suffered against Blackpool on Saturday. The damage has been confirmed as a rupture but, according to a club statement: "The player is expected to be fit for the start of pre-season." Ironically the setback may benefit Tottenham in that the big clubs circling Bale will have to maintain their holding patterns.

"We had our chances but we haven't been able to win games, we've been drawing them," Redknapp said. "That spark we had from people who were winning games for us ... Gareth and Rafa in particular ... we were relying on that. But we've lost that spark that makes the difference. I'm not blaming Gareth or Rafa, I'm just saying that they were so good.

"Gareth was the key. He was flying and, suddenly, we lost him for quite a long time [for six weeks from 22 January]. He hasn't really come back in the same form. In the last couple of months he hasn't got over the injury that he had before and it's taken a toll on him. Rafa has done great for us but, in fairness, he's tapered off after a hard season. In the main he hasn't been as good as he was early on."

Redknapp will seek to add "one or two players that can make the difference" in the summer and he added: "You don't always have to spend big money." United have proved that, he said, with the signing of Javier Hernández for about £7m before this season, while Redknapp also lauded his Bosman capture of William Gallas. There is little doubt, however, that the big bucks would help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000794-5d2e10fe67bdee5292cab242fce66783.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012505 00000000000 015256  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        I get the chance to head out in the field pretty frequently to collect fossils myself. Before starting FossilEra I would take maybe three or four collecting trips a year, but now the job gives me a good excuse to do it a little more frequently. I thought it would be fun to chronical some of my collecting trips on this blog to give people an idea of the type of work that goes into finding specimens like some of those being sold on this site.

Last April I got an invite from Dan Cooper (a true legend in the trilobite world) to join him and a group of about a dozen other trilophiles down on his lease in the Haragan Formation of Oklahoma. The Devonian aged Haragan Formation, produces arguably the most beautiful and highly detailed trilobites in the United States. It has been famously collected by Bob Caroll for over 3 decades at “Black Cat Mountain”. Dan’s lease was basically one hill over from Bob’s lease at Black Cat Mountain. See Oklahoma trilobites for sale on FossilEra, many collected and prepared by Bob.

Prior to the trip, Dan brought out heavy earth moving equipment to expose a section of the most productive layers in the formation. While the Haragan Formation and the overlying Bois d' Arc formation are well over 100 feet thick, complete trilobites are only relatively common in certain layers. A backhoe was used to remove 10-20 feet of solid rock down to just above the start of these productive layers. We spent the first day and a half of the collecting trip removing the final few layers of marlstone above these by hand using large pry bars, wedges, and a 20 lb sledge hammer.

While trilobites can be found exposed on the rock surfaces, they are typically not well preserved either having much of their shell weathered away or being more squished rather than three-dimensional. Getting high quality trilobite specimens requires breaking the rock into progressively smaller pieces and carefully looking for a thin cross-section of a broken trilobite. While it may sound counter intuitive to get the best preserved trilobites, you hope to break the fossils cleanly in half. They can then be glued back together in the lab and the surrounding rock carefully removed under microscope.

Even to experienced eyes, seeing and identifying trilobite cross-sections is very difficult. Throw in the fact that the rock contains lots of trilobite fragments, brachiopods, corals etc and this task gets even harder. Often you need the sunlight to be at just the right angle to be able to see cross sections at all. Sometimes you’ll find yourself finding lots of trilobites early in the morning or in the evening when the sun is at a low angle and then very few when it is directly overhead. The most experienced collectors can determine species, likely orientation, size and chance of being complete.

A Kainops or Paciphacops trilobite cross section. Maybe missing it's tail





While we roughly cracked the overburden layers looking for cross-sections, they yielded very few complete trilobites. I had some excitement when I split through the head and first segment of what I thought could be a monster Huntonia trilobite, possibly 5-6 inches long. Typically you just find heads or tails of these trilobites, but given that I could see one segment in place there seemed to be a sliver of hope it could be complete. Alas after hauling the 20 lbs of rock back it was encased in on the plane and doing some exploratory preparation work, it turned out just to be the head and a single articulated segmen t.

The next four days were pretty much the same repetition. Pry at a large chunk of rock using wedges and pry-bars and then break it down into progressively smaller and smaller pieces until you were left with something maybe about an inch by an inch. In a different day and age this would have been considered prison labor. You’d often go hours without a sign of a trilobite, and then maybe hit a pocket and find several within a five minute period. The most nerve wrecking thing is to make sure you aren’t missing any fragments when you do find one. You always try to keep the area around where you are breaking rock clean and never pitch the recently broken rocks away. Even then you would often find yourself in a half hour hunt for a missing section of trilobite you just split through.

After about 6 days at the quarry it was time to leave and head home. My personal haul included about a dozen phacopids (kainops, paciphacops or reedops), a few Kettneraspis, a Cordania and a couple of potentially really nice Huntonia. Of course, try not to count your trilobites before they are prepared or you’ll often end up disappointed when a trilobite you thought was complete from the field turns out to be incomplete.

One of the things most people take for granted is that the time it takes to find a fossil often pales to the time it takes to prepare one. Every trilobite found had to be cleaned under microscope using air abrasives (think miniature sandblaster) and air scribes (think miniature jack hammer). Even for a small paciphacops found in cross section, this process takes several hours and can take dozens of hours for larger or more ornate trilobites.

Here's the preparation sequence of a large (3 3/4 inch long) Huntonia which was found in cross section.

Hawaii Democrat Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who has served on the Honolulu City Council and in the Hawaii state legislature, represents Hawaii’s 2nd congressional district. Gabbard takes over the seat held in the 112th Congress by Rep. Mazie K. Hirono (D), who on Nov. 6, 2012, became the first Buddhist elected to the Senate.

In 2006, Hirono and Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) became the first Buddhists to be elected to the House. Four years later, they were joined by a third Buddhist member, Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii). Johnson and Hanabusa were re-elected to serve in the 113th Congress.

The first Muslim to serve in either the House or the Senate, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), was elected in 2006. Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.) became the second Muslim in Congress when he won a special election in 2008. In 2012, Michigan Democrat Syed Taj lost his bid to become the third Muslim member of Congress. Ellison and Carson were re-elected.

Members of other small religious groups started serving in Congress more than a century ago. The first Jewish member arrived in 1845, when Lewis Charles Levin of the American Party began representing Pennsylvania in the House. The first Mormon in Congress, John Milton Bernhisel, began serving in 1851, after Utah was officially recognized as a territory. California Democrat Dalip Singh Saund, the first and so far only Sikh to serve in Congress, served three terms starting in 1957.

Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), a Unitarian who joined Congress in 1973, became the first member of Congress to publicly declare, in 2007, that he does not believe in a Supreme Being. He lost his re-election bid in 2012.

Of the 533 members of the new Congress, 299 are Protestant, which is about the same percentage (56 percent) as in the 112th Congress (57 percent) and higher than the share of Protestants in the U.S. adult population (48 percent). But the proportion of Protestants in Congress has been in gradual decline for decades, and the number in the 113th Congress is lower than the number in the previous Congress (307), even if the difference in percentage terms is slight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0000980-37eec11d7e9cc473f7fd4ecf47eb7f47.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011377 00000000000 015445  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Author: Dmitry N.

Product Name: GTX 980 SLI

Join the Discussion Share | NVIDIA GTX 980 SLI Review

Here we are almost two weeks after NVIDIAs GTX 980 and GTX 970 launched and interest hasnt diminished in any way. With that being said, the availability situation has somewhat improved so these cards are getting into peoples hands after initial bout of utterly insufficient allocation. All in all things couldnt be going better for NVIDIAs Maxwell architecture so theres no better time to start looking at how things are looking when theyre placed in an SLI configuration.



The GTX 980 will be the first card out of our multi GPU testing gates simply because we have two reference samples on hand (remember, the GTX 970 doesnt have a reference design per se) and its vying for top-dog status in a pretty competitive segment. To refresh your memory, in a single card configuration it can handily beat the R9 290X and usually remain ahead of NVIDIAs own GTX 780 Ti despite costing just $549.





Since our original review was published, the situation has changed a bit since AMD has very quietly lowered the 290Xs price to $499 for the reference design and even less in some cases provided you can find one with a mail in rebate. That doesnt really change much since the GTX 980 is still miles ahead in quite a few metrics like performance per watt, temperatures and noise output but the R9 290Xs lower cost does make things interesting. Two of these cards could now potentially cost less than $1000 while the pair of GTX 980s will put you back somewhere north of $1100 if you can actually get your hands on two.



While the TITAN Zs astronomical cost of $3000 will lead to its destruction at the hands of Maxwell on a raw perf per dollar front, AMDs own dual GPU card, the R9 295X2 may end up being a bit of a dark horse in this review. Not only is it quiet and relatively compact since it only takes up a single PCI-E slot but it just received a significant price cut as well. At $999, this may give the GTX 980 SLI setup a run for its money.



If we go back in time, these multi card reviews have sometimes ended in disaster, particularly when theres a new architecture to contend with. The success or failure of both SLI and Crossfire hinges on proper driver support which is sometimes lacking this soon after launch. However, given NVIDIAs track record with SLI profiles there shouldnt be any major issues .we hope.

The actor and former pro wrestler tells GQ that a presidential run is "a real possibility."

Johnson says if he were president, leadership would be a top priority.

Johnson isn't revealing much about his political leanings, but says he's not in favor of President Donald Trump's proposed travel ban because he believes "in inclusion."

Johnson declined to endorse anyone in the presidential race last year even though he says both campaigns approached him. Johnson explains that he didn't want to sway anyone's opinion or make people unhappy with his politics.

Johnson would have at least one high-profile backer in NBCUniversal vice chairman Ron Meyer, who tells GQ he'd vote for Johnson "without a question."

A poll released in November but ignored by the mainstream media shows a third of Syrian refugees do not want the Muslim terrorist group ISIS defeated. The survey results buttress concerns by the dozens of U.S. governors who have announced opposition to President Barack Obama’s plan to import 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year.

The poll shows thirteen percent of Syrian refugees have a completely positive opinion of ISIS with another ten percent having mixed feelings on the terror group, suggesting that nearly one quarter are open to recruitment by ISIS.

Factoring the survey results with the 10,000 Syrian refugees Obama plans to bring to the United States means Obama will bring in 1,300 ISIS supporters and a total of 3,100 who do not want the US to defeat ISIS.

The Obama administration imported about 1,600 Syrian refugees in the past fiscal year. That means around 200 Syrian refugee ISIS supporters and a total of nearly 500 Syrian refugee ISIS sympathizers are already in the country.

The telephone poll of 900 Syrian refugees was conducted by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies as part of a larger survey of sis hundred people in each of six Arab nations and the Palestinian territories about ISIS. The group surveyed Syrian refugees in “equal proportion” located in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. The survey also covered residents of Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.

The poll has a margin of error rate of plus or minus four percent.

The survey result for the other Arab countries show similar levels of support for ISIS which ought to prompt a reevaluation of the U.S. policy for immigrants and refugees from the Middle East. The sole exception is Lebanon where less than one percent have a positive view of ISIS.

At the other end of the spectrum, even more supportive of ISIS than the Syrian refugees, are Palestinians.

The survey shows twenty-four percent of Palestinians have a positive view of ISIS with another thirty-six percent only having a somewhat negative opinion of ISIS. The survey also shows Palestinians as the only group where less than fifty percent (48) support the defeat of ISIS .

A Google News search shows only Investors Business Daily and The Blaze have reported on the survey. In Canada, which has pledged to take in 25,000 Syrian refugees, it appears only The Rebel has reported on the survey.                                                                   0000995-6618f891a3578292aa7ffc38ea2f14c5.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006632 00000000000 015060  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Jennifer Pichette has been playing video games since she was a kid. That’s not unusual. Like some people with a lifelong love of video games, she started playing professional tournaments. That’s not unusual either.

Sudbury's Jennifer Pichette is a professional commentator for eSports, but has faced some discrimination as a woman in the male-dominated world of competitive gaming. “It’s just hard for a female gamer to come on the rise, and possibly even be professional," she says. ( Steve Russell / Toronto Star )

Then she realized she liked commentating better than playing professionally, and started commentating online tournaments. Still not unusual. But Jennifer Pichette is a woman, and in the worlds of professional video game playing and commentating, that is unusual, often to the detriment of the woman trying to make it in a burgeoning industry. “Females aren’t taken seriously,” said Pichette, a Sudbury-based Masters of Medical Microbiology student at Laurentian University and commentator who’s known online as LemonKiwi.

“It’s just hard for a female gamer to come on the rise, and possibly even be professional.” Though eSports have been around since the early 1990s, the rise in popularity in the past few years that has helped the once niche hobby turn into a lucrative sport competing for the mainstream. With the jump into mainstream come some growing pains, though. Studies have shown more than half of all gamers are women, but they’re still under-represented in eSports and commentating. Pichette has experienced this first-hand. Being a female “caster” is still seen as an exception rather than the norm — and the problem is worse for players, she said. Men will exclude women from teams, citing a lack of professional experience, but Pichette said it usually has more to do with gender than experience.

“Males want to work with males. Females are used more for their appearance,” she said. “We’re so put to the side as not being skilful enough to be on a male team.” The problem extends to casting. When Pichette comes on a stream, her mostly male audience isn’t expecting a woman to be their caster, and when they find she is, it leads to mixed results.

“When they hear a female voice, they’re kind of thrown off. It’s sometimes not as well accepted,” she said. Comments on her streams will suddenly shift from talking about the game to about how a woman is casting. There is a small silver lining to being noticed all the time. Pichette added that being one of the few female commentators in her industry has helped her stand out. “As much as there (are) cons, there (are) pros,” she said. “You stand out more in the industry when you’re the only female.” The opportunities have been steady for Pichette. She’ll be hosting a Call of Duty tournament at the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo, taking place April 29 to May 1 in Toronto. Pichette still wants more women to have opportunities in gaming. She’s started an all-female professional Call of Duty league, in the hopes that a safer space will encourage more women to consider playing professional eSports. “I just found so many more female gamers getting together and coming out of the dark,” she said. “If the female pro league thing keep going, they’re going to get a lot more sponsor opportunities.” Related: Video game commentators talk up a storm to guide eSports action                                                                                                      0000990-b28e4cddeee13d34136d4d344fc268f6.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001642 00000000000 015253  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In the largest outpouring of celebrity magnanimity since Live AID, a bevy of A-Listers have come out in support of MegaUpload. Huh, apparently the file-sharing service is used for something other than providing me easy access to anime and porn.

MegaUpload has been under fire recently from the likes of the MPAA and the RIAA, who accuse the site of facilitating piracy. They've even gone so far as to dredge up Kim Dotcom's—the founder of MU—previous conviction of "computer hacking" and blasting the company's use of overseas servers.

However, the site does have many legitimate uses for content creators. Folks like P Diddy, Will.i.am, Alicia Keys, Snoop Dogg, Chris Brown, Kanye West, Lil John, Mary J. Blidge, Jamie Foxx, and even Kim Kardashian—who was made famous by her "home video" that was shared extensively on MU—have spoken/sung in favor of the site in this mildly surreal video.

However, in parts of the world where religion can actually be oppressive, bands inspired by Bathory and Mayhem and Burzum are few and far between.

That's presumably because it's a lot easier to be in an anti-Christian metal band in the US, than in an anti-Islamic metal band in Saudi Arabia. In America, your obstacles extend to overhearing your mom tell a friend you're just "going through a phase." In Saudi Arabia, you face social ostracism and the possibility of imprisonment or death.

With that in mind, you've got to give it to Saudi Arabia's only black metal band, Al-Namrood, whose lyrics include all sorts of things that could get them executed. I got in touch with guitarist and bassist Mephisto for a chat.

The artwork for "Ana Al Tughian"

VICE: How did Al-Namrood first come into being and what's the meaning behind your name?

Mephisto: Three men decided to put their aggression into music, specifically black metal. Needless to say, the concepts that are involved in black metal describe what we are experiencing. The band started with the creative idea of combining the Arabic scale with black metal and Arabic lyrics. The main goal was to create something catchy and harsh that fulfils the needs of extreme metal.

Al-Namrood is the Arabic name of the Babylonian king Nimrod, who was a mighty tyrannical king who ruled Babylon with blood and defied the ruler of the universe, according to the tenets of monotheistic religions. We find the title of Al-Namrood to perfectly fit the message of the band. [Literally, Al-Namrood translates to "non-believer."]

What's the motivation for adopting such a vehemently anti-religious stance in such a staunchly Islamic country?

We're fed up with religion. The fact is that everything that is connected to it makes us nauseous. I personally spoke to a shrink. He advised me that whenever I get inflamed I have to express [what I'm feeling]. So here we are, expressing. What can be more motivating than living in a place where everything is controlled by religion? Basically, individuals here have no rights to do anything. We're owned by the Islamic sharia. Everything we do must be justified by Islam and acknowledged by society. There are two outrageous powers: religion and our society. They both interact and fulfil each other.

In what way?

While there's a lot of hypocrisy, it has been demonstrated that the local people are very much in agreement with the Islamic system. For example, in Islam, music is generally forbidden, but Muslim people listen to it on the basis that "God forgives." But when it comes to freedom of choice, "God never forgives." Everything is chosen for an individual from birth until death. A child is born and raised to become Muslim and never given a choice to look at other religions. Education is highly biased and focused upon the Islamic world. There is no chance of considering multiple points of views. The only view that can be adopted is the view of the acknowledged tradition and approved religious practice. Freedom of expression is a crime, justified by the fact that "it can disturb the peace." Even in marriage you cannot choose your partner. Rather, the elders choose for you. This social approach mixed with religious control is normally practiced in our country with no objection.

The music video for "Bat Al Tha ar Nar Muheja"

How did you first become interested in metal? I can't imagine black metal CDs are particularly easy to get hold of in Saudi Arabia.

It happened gradually, of course. When we were exposed to metal, we started basic, then we elevated to the extreme. We liked the concept of black metal, as it describes the irrationality of religion. Of course, this context exists in other genres, like death metal, but we lent more towards black metal because it has many elements of punk metal, which has awesome music and concepts. We purchased CDs from neighboring countries and smuggled them in discreetly. We educated ourselves about the outside world by also purchasing smuggled books, thanks to some amazing crazy friends, and then the internet came to extend our knowledge massively.

I've read that you never use your real names and never have your photos published, and that even your families don't know that you make metal. Going to such lengths to remain anonymous must be quite a strain.

Not at all. We've been doing this from childhood. I mean, we've had a different perspective than the rest of our society from an early age, and we've learned that sharing these views is not feasible for us. Some of us tried hard to fit in and share our thoughts, but ended up serving time in jail, so the lifestyle of being mentally isolated from the surrounding environment started from an early age. When it came to our musical approach, we just applied the same methodology of coping.

Why do you think that, in spite of the fact that metal bands frequently incorporate an anti-religious sentiment into their lyrics, there have been so few bands that have said anything negative about Islam?

Simply because they haven't experienced it. Christianity nowadays is passive. The church doesn't control the country. I think whatever rage that people have got against the church cannot be compared with Islamic regimes. You can criticize the church under freedom of speech in European countries, but you can't do that in Middle Eastern countries. The system doesn't allow it. Islam has inflicted more authority on the Middle East than any other place in the world. Every policy has to be aligned with sharia law, and this is happening right now in 2015. We know that, 400 years ago, brutality occurred in the name of the church, but the same is happening right now in this age with Islam.

What kind of obstacles do you encounter when it comes to recording your music?

The obstacles are greater than colossal—it's like living in a cave and demanding electricity. In radical Islamic countries, this music is considered to be a crime by Islamic law. We are living our lives in isolation. Basically, our identity is hidden and our musical interests are kept top secret. It's risky, and the risk gets bigger if we want to publicize our band. However, the obstacles do not stop at social aspects. Also, the lack of availability of decent musical equipment is an issue, and getting the musical equipment into the country can be a problem.

Have you ever played a live show, or is that straight up impossible?

It's impossible, because it's illegal. We can be sentenced to death if we do them.

Your lyrics focus heavily upon the demons and jinn of pre-Islamic Arabia. What's the inspiration for this?

We were taught in school that Arabs were living in utter darkness before Islam came to illuminate the people, but we find history more interesting than the post-Islamic world. We also like some Arabian tales from the Middle Ages, like One Thousand and One Nights.

You mentioned that you made a conscious decision to incorporate regional instruments into your songs. Can you tell me about that?

Yes. When we compose a song we can sense that a particular part can use Arabic instruments, such as an oud or a qanoon. The tricky part is figuring out how to combine the quarter tone with guitar tuning. Once this part is done, the rest just comes along. We are not experts in music production. We just make music that is pleasing to our ears. Some parts just come naturally, and some parts require revising and editing.

Do you ever see a day when Saudi Arabia will have a fully-fledged black metal scene?

Judging by the direction that the country is heading in, I would say not in a thousand years.

Thanks, Mephisto.

The man is a genius.

Today, at his Twitter feed, the comedian came up with a clever bit of reverse psychology about voting in next week’s election, when Democrats may lose control of the US Senate because of poor turnout.

As we pointed out last week, one big problem Democrats have is that young voters just don’t give a crap about midterm elections.

Without the White House on the line, turnout among young voters — who tend to favor Democratic candidates — slumps badly, while older, whiter and more conservative voters turn out at high rates. For example, during the last midterm election in Kentucky, where this year one of the tightest Senate races is happening, the youngest voters turned out at only about 23 percent, while older male Republican voters turned out at 72.2 percent.

And the thing is, some of these races are so close, if young voters would just get themselves to the polls, they could easily decide several of the most crucial contests.

But how to motivate them? Fugelsang took the sarcastic approach to brilliant effect in a series of tweets on Tuesday evening…

Not one to rest on his superhero laurels, Gabriel upped his goal to 200 units. He’s practically there at 175 units.

“In the clinic at McMaster Sick Kids Hospital Gabe sees so many children receiving this blood of strength and he’s always hoping that his fellow patients are receiving units he’s helped raise,” said mom Sabrina.

Through a Facebook page called #IronGabe he “inspires nearly 700 fans” with an unyielding attitude of optimism and strength.

“He’s the boy who despite nausea and vomiting after a chemo treatment refused to be late to baseball or soccer practice, and who willed away a fever that required hospitalization so that he could go see a Blue Jays home game this summer,” said his mom.

Gabriel likens cancer to having a pebble in his shoe, annoying but incapable of stopping him on his journey to defeat it, for himself and others.

When he’s not in superhero mode he’s a big brother to Giada, 5, and Giulia, 2, and a Grade 2 student at Holy Rosary School in Aldershot. Pokémon, the Blue Jays and his buddies also figure prominently in Gabriel’s world.

"But who cares what I think?" Bush said during a speech at Boston College on Thursday, according to the Boston Herald.

Bush, the former governor of Florida who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, said he wished the president would focus on work.

"It would be great to get back to the business of governing and less about the swirling controversies. I just think the president needs to focus on doing his job," Bush said.

"The judicial appointments have been good, he's got a great foreign policy team, he should be president and stop creating all the controversies — let that process take its place."

However, the former governor noted that he did not vote for Trump, but had high hopes for the president's campaign plan to "drain the swamp" in Washington.

"'Drain the swamp' was a classic line. It resonated with me… I didn't vote for the guy, I'm not a big fan and everybody knows that, but I was hopeful that he would drain the swamp and the swamp-draining would include lobbying reform," Bush said.

At another point during his speech, Bush said he believed the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of the Russia probe, was more important than Comey's testimony.

"There is a process underway and the testimony today is not as relevant to me, in that regard, as Mr. Mueller's activity," he said.                                                                   0000851-39e417cf5b10c10d5b99c39ce273f45b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004345 00000000000 015111  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Just a thought, which I decided to scribble down before I forgot it.

Key policy: Epigram is a declare-before-use language, temporally as well as spatially. When you say x, you get the most local existing x at that time, or you get a new x generated as locally as possible. In a declaration, spare names go into the generalisation prefix; in a rhs, spare names go into the where clause, one way or another. Naming is a surrogate for pointing, so once the bond of reference is created, it must not be broken by ill-propagated renamings, capturings, or whatever. It’s this policy which enables scope resolution at any point in time: there should never be any issue about the referent of an identifier.

Now, we go backwards as well as forwards, this time around, so what happens when you delete information. Well, there are at least two sorts of undo: devaluation (removing (parts of) the value of a symbol) and degeneration (removing the symbol altogether). Now, you propagate a devaluation by rechecking and devaluing everything which depends on a devalued symbol. Degeneration is much scarier. But I remember now, there’s a funny thing. If you set things up right, you don’t need degeneration, exactly…

Imagine we have only let (the sooner we turn data into sugar for let, the better). You can devalue a let, replacing the top rhs by a shed. Now, key editing move: you can commute one let past another by turning

let f blah ; let g waffle

into

let g waffle ; let f blah

if waffle does not depend on f, or

let g waffle where f blah ; let f blah

otherwise. Degeneration is thus the repetition of this refactoring until the global f falls off the end!

(For data as it is now, you need to generate a bunch of lets for the type, its constructors and its various gadgets.)

In terms of what happens to typedness, we should try to ensure that devaluation cannot increase the amount of brown. Intuitively, removing information cannot increase the amount of stuff which is definitely wrong. Of course, we should expect yellow all over the shop.

I mention this largely because this is pretty fundamental stuff, in terms of the propagation of updates around the system. It’s rooted in the proof engine, below the elaboration layer, so the time to figure it out is now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0000974-b50577dc003e75112e5f261520934515.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003235 00000000000 014435  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have confirmed the presence of S. aureus, including MRSA, on raw meat products. We investigated the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus and MRSA in commercially-distributed antibiotic-free and conventional raw meat products (n = 3290) purchased in 8 Iowa retail stores weekly for a period of one year. Isolates were characterized using spa typing, and PCR was used to detect the presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and mecA genes. Quantitation of S. aureus on meat products was carried out one week per month. The prevalence of S. aureus on meat samples was 27.8% (913/3290). Compared to antibiotic-free meat samples, higher prevalence of both MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were found in conventional meat samples. Among the S. aureus isolates, 18 were PVL-positive (1.9%) and 41 (4.5%) carried mecA. Phenotypic oxacillin resistance was observed for 17.1% (41/239) of the isolates tested, while 23% (55/239) were multi-drug resistant. A total of 132 spa types were detected from 913 contaminated meat samples. Overall, t002 was the most common spa type identified (137; 15.0%). The number of colony-forming units (CFU) per 10 g meat ranged from 2 to 517 (median: 8 CFU per 10 g of meat; mean: 28) with the highest bacterial load observed on turkey samples. These data reinforce the need to consider meat products as potential vehicles of S. aureus transmission from farm into human households, and the potential need for public health intervention programs pre and post-slaughter in meat processing facilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0000975-1a317dc24b47000537a27df8e006a6a9.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005753 00000000000 014737  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        UPDATE: Donald Trump's campaign issued a statement Tuesday, clarifying his remarks.

Donald Trump seemed to make a strange suggestion Monday that President Obama was somehow connected to the Orlando nightclub massacre that claimed the lives of 49 people early Sunday morning.

The indirect accusation came in an interview with Fox News Channel's "Fox and Friends" Monday.

"[W]e're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind," he said. And he went on to say, "[T]he something else in mind, you know, people can't believe it," Trump said.

He went on to say twice that there was "something going on."

"People cannot -- they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism," Trump told Fox News. "There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on."

He made similarly ominous and unsubstantiated suggestions on NBC's "Today Show" that Mr. Obama was somehow involved in the attacks, saying that maybe the president "doesn't want to get it" or "he gets it better than anybody understands," he said. "He doesn't get it or he gets it better than anybody understands."

But then, asked to elaborate on the implicit accusation, Trump backed off a little, accusing the president of mere incompetence, rather than malicious intent, though he suggested that unnamed others thought there was a connection.

"I happen to think that he just doesn't know what he's doing," Trump said, "but there are many people that think he doesn't want to get it. He doesn't want to see what's really happening."

On Sunday, Trump said that Obama should step down as president because he refuses to say "radical Islamic terrorism," and warned on "CBS This Morning" on Monday that more Orlando-style attacks will continue to occur if Mr. Obama doesn't start talking about "radical Islamic terrorism."

"Believe me, all I want is safety, I want safety for this country," Trump told "CBS This Morning" in a phone interview. "What happened yesterday will happen many times over with a president like Obama that doesn't even want to use the term 'radical Islamic terrorism.'"

Trump said Sunday that the massacre was proof that the U.S. government should implement his Muslim ban. His proposal, however, would block Muslims from entering the U.S., while the shooter, Omar Mateen, was born in New York to Afghan-born parents.

The president addressed the nation about the attack on Sunday afternoon, condemning the shooting at the gay nightclub in Orlando that left 49 people dead and 53 more wounded.

Mr. Obama said that while the investigation is still underway, it is clear the shooting was an "act of terror and an act of hate." Mateen had pledged allegiance to ISIS in a phone call to 911 during the attack.

The president received a briefing update Monday morning in the Oval Office from FBI Director James Comey, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and other administration officials.

It's announced today that a broader rollout is underway that will see most of its sites get a new "app launcher" in its place. That new interface should be familiar to anyone who's used Android or Chrome OS; it simply consists of a small icon in the top right of each page that expands to reveal a grid of larger icons. According to Google, the change is being done to make getting around various Google services more "seamless," and eliminate any distractions once you're inside an app.

Along with the menu bar change, Google has also confirmed that it's "refined the color palette and letter shapes" of its logo, and that the updated version of it will be making its way across the company's various offerings along with the new menu bar. You can apparently expect those changes to occur over the next few weeks.      0000844-2fbffbbbe61da4f45b50da41a05d9a51.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006471 00000000000 015445  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Toronto

The Amazon has overflowed, all the way up into Canada.

Canadians now have a new option when it comes to streaming, thanks to Amazon Prime Video.

Amazon announced Wednesday that it is bringing its video streaming service north of the border as part of a rollout in more than 200 countries and territories.

Amazon Prime Video is the home of such shows as the Emmy-winning Transparent, Mozart in the Jungle, The Man in the High Castle, The Grand Tour, Woody Allen’s Crisis in Six Scenes and David E. Kelley’s Goliath featuring Billy Bob Thornton, among others. And the Seattle-based company is promising even more original programming in 2017.

If you already are a member of Amazon Prime in Canada, you will be able to access the streaming service at no additional cost.

If you’re new, membership will set you back $79 per year after a 30-day free trial. The service also includes free same-day shipping for some orders (you know, books, Blu-rays, doodads) in Toronto and Vancouver.

The announcement comes after Shomi, the short-lived streaming service initiated by Rogers and Shaw, shuttered at the end of November.

Shomi, which launched in 2014, was the Canadian outlet for Amazon’s Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle. But many of the shows on the Amazon docket — including some that are filmed in Canada — have not been available here previously.

The emergence of original programming on Amazon Prime in recent years had come to give Canadians the impression that they were falling behind, again. Even if you weren’t particularly interested in any specific Amazon show, one thing that’s certain is Canadians don’t like being shut out of things. In fact, Canadians kind of believe they have a "right" to see and access all entertainment produced in the United States, which, of course, is not technically the case.

Anyway, the only streaming services that have a chance in today’s world are the ones that are producing their own content. Netflix has become an entertainment behemoth. Amazon has intriguing shows and is growing.

In Canada specifically, Shomi failed because there’s only so much "library content," and people aren’t excited anymore by past seasons of whatever. Meanwhile, Bell’s CraveTV at least is trying to put up a fight, combining library content with some exclusive HBO and Showtime series, as well as the Canadian original (both literally and figuratively) Letterkenny.

But just last month, Bell Media president Mary Ann Turcke expressed concern about the possibility of Amazon coming into the Canadian market at a hearing before Canada’s broadcast regulator. She said it could make it more difficult to acquire the buzzy titles needed to satisfy subscribers. The way around that, of course, is to make your own buzzy content, but if that were easy, everyone would be doing it.

“It’s not just our fellow Canadian broadcasters who will try to outbid us for first run, original programming, but it’s Netflix and now Amazon, two entities that are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as us and that have astronomically more buying power than we do,” Turcke told the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

CraveTV reportedly has one-million subscribers, with Netflix rumoured to be in the homes of 48% of all English-speaking Canadians.

Masters student Tyler Thompson, 27, said he had been left “heartbroken” by the incident, which happened on Tuesday and involved a group of pupils from St Thomas of Aquin’s High School.

The incident unfolded outside a Sainsbury’s outlet on Simpson Loan and police said patrols would be stepped up in the area.

Mr Thompson, who is studying counselling and psychotherapy at Edinburgh University, said he was shocked by what happened and was “fearful” it could happen again.

He said the incident involved around 30 students but had been instigated by a smaller group of about four or five as he went to enter the supermarket at lunchtime.

He described seeing the students mucking around and throwing food but when he asked them to stop was then subjected to a torrent of homophobic verbal abuse.

The pupils made derogatory remarks about his hair – which is currently dyed pink – and his American accent, he added.

He said: “I was just minding my own business, walking into Sainsbury’s. They were throwing food at each other and some almost hit me and I said OK guys, what’s going on – please stop.

“They said we don’t have to listen to you. They heard my American accent and said ‘go back to your country’.

“I grew up in Texas and was never treated this way. It made me feel horrible. The entire time insults were being thrown at me.”

Mr Thompson said one pupil did come in after him to apologise and that he had been “really touched” by the gesture.

He later spoke to the school’s headteacher on the phone and said he was offered an apology.

St Thomas of Aquin’s is one of 23 high schools under the city council’s remit.

A council spokesperson said: “As soon as the school was made aware of the allegation staff gathered information to check if any pupils were involved.

“The headteacher contacted the police and has personally been in touch with the complainant to apologise.

“The school does not tolerate behaviour of this kind and is co-operating fully with police inquiries.”

A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “Police in Edinburgh are investigating after a 27-year-old man was harassed by a group of youths at a supermarket in Simpson Loan sometime between 12pm and 1pm on Tuesday, October 3.

“During the incident offensive comments were made towards the victim and this matter is being treated as a hate crime.

“Offences of this nature will not be tolerated and inquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible.

“There will be additional patrols in the area and we will be working with the local schools to raise awareness that this behaviour is totally unacceptable.

“Anyone with information is asked to come forward.”

J. Krishnamurti Second Conversation with Dr Allen W. Anderson in San Diego, California

18 February 1974



TRANSCRIPT

A Wholly Different Way of Living



J. Krishnamurti was born in South India and educated in England. For the past 40 years he has been speaking in the United States, Europe, India, Australia and other parts of the world. From the outset of his life's work he repudiated all connections with organised religions and ideologies, and said that his only concern was to set man absolutely unconditionally free. He is the author of many books, among them The Awakening of Intelligence, The Urgency of Change, Freedom From the Known, and The Flight of the Eagle.



This is one of a series of dialogues between Krishnamurti and Dr. Allan W. Anderson, who is professor of religious studies at San Diego State University where he teaches Indian and Chinese scriptures and the oracular tradition. Dr. Anderson, a published poet, received his degree from Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary. He has been honoured with the distinguished teaching award from the California State University.



A: Mr Krishnamurti, in our previous conversation I was extremely delighted, for myself at least, that we had made the distinction in terms of relation between knowledge and self transformation, between on the one hand, the relationship that I sustain with the world, as the world is me, and I am the world, and on the other hand this dysfunctional condition which indicates in your phrase, that a person is involved in thinking, that the description is the described. It would appear then that something must be done to bring about a change in the individual, and going back to our use of the word individual, we could say, and you used the word earlier, that we are dealing with an observer. So if the individual is not to make the mistake of taking the description for the described, then he must as an observer relate to the observed in a particular way that is totally different from the way he has been in his confusion. I thought that perhaps in this particular conversation, if we pursued that it would be a link directly with what we had said prior.



K: What we previously, wasn't it surely that there must be a quality of freedom from the known, otherwise the known is merely the repetition of the past, the tradition, the image, and so on. The past, sir, is the observer. The past is the accumulated knowledge as the 'me' and the 'we', 'they' and 'us'. The observer is put together by thought as the past. Thought is the past. Thought is never free. Thought is never new, because thought is the response of the past, as knowledge, as experience, as memory.



A: Yes I follow that.



K: And the observer, when he observes, is observing with the memories, experiences, knowledge, hurts, despairs, hope - all that, with all that background he looks at the observed. So the observer then becomes separate from the observed. Is the observer different from the observed? Which we will go into presently later on. That leads to all kinds of other things. So when we are talking of freedom from the known we are talking about the freedom from the observer.



A: The observer, yes.



K: And the observer is tradition, the past, the conditioned mind that looks at things, looks at itself, looks at the world, looks at me and so on. So the observer is always dividing. The observer is the past and therefore it cannot observe wholly.



A: If the person uses the first person pronoun, 'I', while he is taking the description for the described, this is the observer he refers to when he says, 'I'.



K: 'I' is the past.



A: I see



K: 'I' is the whole structure of what has been, the remembrances, the memories, the hurts, the various demands, all that is put together in the word, 'the I', who is the observer, and therefore division: the observer and the observed. The observer who thinks he is a Christian and observes a non-Christian or a Communist, this division, this attitude of mind which observes with conditioned responses, with memories and so on. So that is the known.



A: I see.



K: I mean I think that is logically so.



A: Oh, no, it follows precisely from what you have said.



K: So, we are asking, can the mind or the whole structure, can the mind be free from the known? Otherwise the repetitious action, repetitious attitudes, repetitious ideologies, will go on, modified, changed, but it will be the same direction.



A: Do go ahead, I was going to say something but I think I'll let it wait until you have finished what you have said.



K: So, what is this freedom from the known? I think that is very important to understand because, any creative action - I am using the word creative in its original sense, not in the sense creative writing, creative...



A: I know



K: ...bakery, creative essay, creative pictures. I am not talking in that sense. In the deeper sense of that word, creation means something totally new being born. It is not creative, it is merely repetitive, modified, changed, the past. So unless there is a freedom from the known there is no creative action at all. Which is freedom implies not the negation of the known but the understanding of the known and that understanding brings about an intelligence which is the very essence of freedom.



A: I'd like to make sure that I've understood your use of this word creative. It seems to me very important. People who use the word creative in the sense that you described, creative this that or the other...



K: That's a horror. That is a dreadful way of using that word.



A: ...because what the issue is of their activity is something merely novel.



K: Novel, novel, that's right.



A: Not radically new, but novel.



K: It's like creative writing, teaching creative writing. It's so absurd.



A: Exactly. Yes, now I do, I think, grasp precisely the distinction you have made. And I must say I fully agree with that.



K: Unless you feel new you cannot create anything new.



A: That's right. And the person who imagines that he is creative in this other sense that we pointed to is a person whose reference for his activity is this observer that we mentioned that is tied to the past.



K: Yes, that's right.



A: So even if something does appear that is really extraordinarily novel, merely novel, but still extraordinarily novel, they are kidding themselves.



K: The novel is not the creative.



A: Exactly.



K: The novel is just the...



A: And today especially, it seems to me in our culture, we have become hysterical about this because in order to be creative one must simply wrack his brains in order to produce something, which in itself is bizarre enough to get attention.



K: That's all. Attention, success.



A: Yes. It has to be novel to the degree that I feel knocked on the head by it.



K: Eccentric, and all the rest.



A: Exactly. But if that tension is increased, then with each succeeding generation the person is put to tremendous stress not to repeat the past, which he can't help repeating.



K: Repeating quite.



A: Exactly.



K: That's why I say freedom is one thing and knowledge is another. We must relate the two to see whether the mind can be free from knowledge. We won't go into it now. This is real meditation for me. You follow, sir?



A: Yes I do.



K: Because when we talk about meditation - we will go into it - but to see whether the brain can record and be free not to record, the brain to record and operate when necessary in the recording, in the memory, in knowledge, and be free to observe without the observer.



A: Oh yes, yes. I see, that distinction seems to me to be absolutely necessary, otherwise it wouldn't be intelligible.



K: So knowledge is necessary to act in the sense, my going home from here to the place I live; I must have knowledge. I must have knowledge to speak English. I must have knowledge to write a letter, and so on, everything. The knowledge as function, mechanical function, is necessary. Now if I use that knowledge in my relationship with you, another human being I am bringing about a barrier, a division between you and me, who is the observer. Am I making myself clear?



A: I am the observed in that case.



K: Yes.



A: Right in that context.



K: That is, knowledge in a relationship, in human relationship, is destructive,



A: Yes.



K: That is, knowledge which is the tradition, the memory, the image, which the mind has built about you when we are related together, that knowledge is separative and therefore creates conflict in that relationship. As we said earlier, where there is division there must be conflict. Division between India and Pakistan, India and America, Russia and all that, this divisive activity politically, religiously, economically, socially, in every way must inevitably bring conflict and therefore violence. That's obvious.



A: Exactly.



K: Now, when in relationship, in human relationship, knowledge comes between then in that relationship there must be conflict - between husband and wife, boy and girl, wherever there is the operation as the observer who is the past, who is knowledge, in that activity there is division, and therefore conflict in relationship.



A: So now the question that comes up next is the one of freedom from, being subject to this repetitive round.



K: Yes, that's right,



A: Good, good,



K: Now is that possible? It is an immense question because human beings live in relationship.



A: Yes.



K: There is no life without relationship. Life means to be related.



A: Exactly.



K: People who retire into a monastery and all that, they are still related, however they might like to think they are alone, they are actually related, related to the past.



A: Oh yes, very much so.



K: To their saviour, to their Christ, to their Buddha, you follow, all that, they are related to the past.



A: And their rules.



K: And their rules, everything.



A: Yes.



K: They live in the past and therefore they are the most destructive people because they are not creative in the deeper sense of that word.



A: No, and they also, in so far as they are involved in this confusion that you have been talking about, are not even producing anything novel. Not that that means anything, but perhaps that would rather radically...



K: The novel would be for a man who is talkative to enter a monastery where they don't talk.



A: Yes.



K: That's a novel to him and he says that's a miracle!



A: Right.



K: So our problem then is, what place has knowledge in human relationship?



A: Yes, that's the problem.



K: That's one problem.



A: Yes.



K: Because relationship with human beings is the highest importance, obviously, because out of that relationship we create the society in which we live. Out of that relationship all our existence comes.



A: This would take us back again to the earlier statement: I am the world and the world is me. That is a statement about relationship. It's a statement about many other things too, but that is a statement about relationship. The statement: the description is not the described, is the statement of the rupture of this relationship...



K: That's right.



A: ...in terms of everyday activity.



K: Sir, everyday activity is my life, is our life.



A: Is everything. Yes precisely.



K: Whether I go to the office, the factory, or drive a bus or whatever it is, it is life, living.



A: But it is interesting, isn't it, that even when that rupture is undergone, at a very destructive level, what we call thought in the context of our description of it and image becomes itself, even distorted.



K: Of course, of course,



A: So that the distortion that we've been calling knowledge in terms of its application - not as you described as, 'I need to know how to get from here to there', no of course - can itself suffer an even worse condition than we are presently related to; and we have tomes upon tomes about that pathology in itself don't we? Please, please do go on.



K: So knowledge and freedom: they must both exist together, not freedom and knowledge. It's the harmony between the two. The two operating all the time in relationship.



A: The knowledge and freedom in harmony.



K: In harmony. It's like they can never be divorced. If I want to live with you in great harmony, which is love - which we will discuss that later on - there must be this absolute sense of freedom from you, not dependency, and so on, and so on, and so on, this absolute sense of freedom and operating at the same time in the field of knowledge.



A: Exactly. So somehow this knowledge, if I may use a theological word here without prejudicing what we are talking about, if in correct relationship with this freedom is somehow continuously redeemed, it is somehow operating no longer destructively but in co-ordination with the freedom in which I may live, because we haven't got to that freedom yet, we are just positing freedom.



K: We have somewhat analysed, or discussed, or opened the question of knowledge.



A: Yes.



K: And we haven't gone into the question of freedom, what it means.



A: No, but we have established something, I think this conversation so far has revealed, which is terribly important, at least I'd say for my students in terms of helping them not to misunderstand what you are saying.



K: Quite.



A: I have the feeling that many persons because they are not sufficiently attentive to what you say simply dismiss many statements you say out of hand as...



K: ...impossible.



A: ...impossible, or if they like the aesthetics of it it still doesn't apply to them. It's a lovely thing out there, wouldn't it be great if somehow we could do this. But you see you haven't said that. You haven't said what they think you have said. You've said something about knowledge with respect to pathology and you've said something about knowledge in which knowledge itself is no longer destructive.



K: No.



A: So we're not saying that knowledge as such is the bad guy and something else is the good guy.



K: No.



A: No, I think it is terribly important that that's seen, and I wouldn't mind it being repeated over and over again, because I do heartily feel that it's easy to misunderstand.



K: That's very important because religion, at least the meaning of word is to gather together to be attentive. That is the true meaning of that word, religion, I have looked it up in a dictionary.



A: Oh yes, I agree.



K: Gathering together all energy to be attentive; to be attentive, otherwise it's not religion. Religion is all the things - we'll discuss that when we come to it. So freedom means the sense of complete austerity and a sense of total negation of the observer.



A: Exactly.



K: Out of that comes austerity, everything else. We'll go into that later on.



A: But austerity in itself doesn't produce it.



K: No. Upside down.



A: So we've turned that upside down.



K: Austere means really, the word itself means ash, dry, brittle. But the austerity of which we are talking about is something entirely different.



A: Yes.



K: It is the freedom that brings about this austerity inwardly.



A: There is a beautiful Biblical phrase that points to this, just three words, 'beauty for ashes' when the transformation takes place. And in English we have the phrase ashes in the mouth when the whole thing has come to ashes. But there is a change from ashes to beauty.



K: So freedom in action in the field of knowledge and in the field of human relationship, because that is the highest importance, human relationship.



A: Oh yes, yes. Oh yes, particularly if I am the world and the world is me.



K: Obviously.



A: Yes.



K: So what place has knowledge in human relationship? Knowledge in the sense of past experience, tradition, image.



A: Yes.



K: What has the observer, who is the observer, all that is the observer, what place has the observer in human relationship?



A: What place has knowledge on the one hand, what place has the observer.



K: Observer is the knowledge



A: Is the knowledge. But there is the possibility of seeing knowledge, not simply negatively, but in co-ordination, in true creative relationship.



K: I have said that.



A: Right. Exactly.



K: I am related to you let's say, to make it very simple. I'm related to you, You are my brother, husband or wife, whatever it is, and what place has knowledge as the observer, which is the past, and knowledge is the past, what place has that in our relationship?



A: If our relationship is creative...



K: It is not. Not 'if', we must take it actually as it is. I am related to you, I am married to you, I am your wife or husband whatever it is. Now what is the actuality in that relationship? The actuality, not theoretical actuality, but the actuality is that I am separate from you.



A: The actuality must be that we are not divided.



K: But we are. I may call you my husband, my wife, but I am concerned with my success, I am concerned with my money, I am concerned with my ambitions, my envy, I am full of me.



A: Yes I see that, but I want to make sure now that we haven't reached a confusion here.



K: Yes we have.



A: When I say that the actuality is that we are not separate, I do not mean to say that at the phenomenal level that a dysfunction is occurring. I am fully aware of that. But if we are going to say that the world is me and I am the world...



K: We say it theoretically we don't feel it.



A: Precisely. But if that is the case, that the world is me and I am the world and this is actual, this is actual...



K: This is actual only when I have no division in myself.



A: Exactly. Exactly.



K: But I have a division.



A: If I have a division then there is no relationship between one and the other.



K: Therefore I accept, one accepts the idea that the world is me and me is the world. That is just an idea. Look sir.



A: Yes, I understand.



K: But if...



A: But if and when it happens...



K: Wait. Just see what takes place in my mind. I make a statement of that kind, the world is you and you are the world. The mind then translates it into an idea, into a concept and tries to live according to that concept.



A: Exactly.



K: It has abstracted from reality.



A: This is knowledge in the destructive sense.



K: I won't call it destructive or positive. This is what is going on.



A: Well let's say the issue from it is hell.



K: Yes. So in my relationship with you what place has knowledge, the past, the image which is the observer, all that is the observer, what place has the observer in our relationship? Actually the observer is the factor of division.



A: Right.



K: And therefore the conflict between you and me, this is what is going on in the world everyday.



A: Then one would have to say, it seems to me, following the conversation point by point, that the place of this observer, understood as you have pointed out, is the point of dysrelationship.



K: Is the point where there is really actually no relationship at all. I may sleep with my wife, and so on and so on but actually there is no relationship because I have my own pursuits, my own ambitions, all the idiosyncrasies, and so on and she has hers, so we are always separate and therefore always in battle with each other. Which means the observer as the past is the factor of division.



A: Yes, I was just wanting to be sure that the phrase is the place, of what is the place of the observer was understood in the context of what we are saying. We have made the statement that there is such a thing.



K: Yes.



A: Well its place as such would seem to me not to be what we usually mean by its occupying a place.



K: Yes.



A: We are talking rather about an activity here that is profoundly disordered.



K: Sir, as long as there is the observer, there must be conflict in relationship.



A: Yes, I follow that.



K: Wait, wait, see what happens. I make a statement of that kind, someone will translate that into an idea, into a concept and say, 'How am I to live that concept?' The fact is he doesn't observe himself as the observer.



A: That's right. That's right. He is the observer looking out there making a distinction between himself and the...



K: ...and the statement.



A: Right. Making a division.



K: Has the observer any place at all in relationship? I say, the moment he comes into existence in relationship there is no relationship.



A: The relationship is not.



K: Is not.



A: It is not something that is in dysrelationship.



K: Yes that's right.



A: We are talking about something, that in fact doesn't even exist.



K: Exist. Therefore we have to go into the question why human beings in their relationship with other human beings are so violent, because that is spreading throughout the world. I was told the other day in India, a mother came to see me, very Brahmanical family, very cultured and all the rest of it, her son who is six, when she asked him to do something he took up a stick and began to hit her. A thing unknown. You follow, sir?



A: Yes.



K: The idea that you should hit your mother is traditionally something incredible. And this boy did it. And I said, 'See what is the fact', we went into it, she understood. So to understand violence one has to understand division.



A: The division was already there.



K: Yes.



A: Otherwise he would not have picked up the stick.



K: Division between nations, you follow sir?



A: Yes.



K: This race for armaments is one of the factors of violence. Which is, I am calling myself American and he is calling himself Russian or Hindu or whatever it is, this division is the factor of real violence and hatred. If a mind, not 'if', when mind sees that it cuts away all division in himself. He is no longer a Hindu, American, Russian. He is a human being with his problems which he is then trying to solve, not in terms of India, or America or Russia. So we come to the point, can the mind be free in relationship, which means orderly, not chaotic, orderly?



A: It has to be otherwise you couldn't use the word relationship.



K: No. No. So can the mind be free of that? Free of the observer?



A: If not, there is no hope.



K: That's the whole point.



A: If not, we've had it.



K: Yes. And all the escapes and going off into other religions, doing all kinds of tricks, has no meaning. Now, this demands a great deal of perception, insight into the fact of your life: how one lives one's life. After all philosophy means the love of truth, love of wisdom, not the love of some abstraction.



A: Oh no, no, no. Wisdom is supremely practical.



K: Practical. Therefore here it is. That is, can a human being live in relationship in freedom and yet operate in the field of knowledge?



A: And yet operate in the field of knowledge, yes.



K: And be absolutely orderly. Otherwise it is not freedom. Because order means virtue.



A: Yes, yes.



K: Which doesn't exist in the world at the present time. There is no sense of virtue in anything. Then we repeat. Virtue is a creative thing, is a living thing, is a moving thing.



A: I am thinking as you are saying this about virtue, which is really power, which is really the ability to act; and if I am following you correctly what you are really saying, and please correct me if I am way off here, what you are really saying is that the ability to act in the strict sense, which must be creative, otherwise it's not an action but is simply a reaction.



K: A repetition.



A: A repetition. That the ability to act, or virtue, as you put it, bears with it necessarily the implication of order. it must. It seems to me no way out of that.



K: Yes.



A: I just wanted to recover that a step at a time.



K: So can I come back. In human relationship as it exists now, we are looking at that, what actually is, in that human relationship there is conflict, sexual violence and so on and so on, every kind of violence. Now, can man live at total peace - otherwise he is not creative - in human relationship, because that is the basis of all life.



A: I'm very taken with the way you have pursued this. I notice that when we asked this question, 'is it possible that', the reference for it is always a totality.



K: Yes.



A: And the reference over here is a fragment, or a fragmentation, or a division. Never once have you said that the passage from the one to the other is a movement that even exists.



K: No. It can't exist.



A: You see.



K: Absolutely.



A: I think Mr Krishnamurti, that nothing is so difficult to grasp as this statement that you have made. There is nothing that we are taught, from childhood up to render such a possibility, a matter for taking seriously, because when - well of course, one doesn't like to make sweeping statements about the way everyone has been educated but I'm thinking of myself, from a child upward, all the way through graduate school, accumulating a lot of this knowledge that you have been talking about. I don't remember anybody saying to me, or even pointing me to a literature that so categorically makes this distinction between one and the other as in terms of each other, not accessible to each other through passage.



K: No. No, no, quite, quite.



A: Now, I'm correct in understanding you there, aren't I?



K: Quite right.



A: Maybe I could just say this as an aside.



K: The fragment can not become the whole.



A: No. The fragment cannot become the whole, in and of itself.



K: But the fragment is always trying to become the whole.



A: Exactly. Exactly. Now of course, in the years of very serious and devoted contemplation and exploration of this which quite clearly you have undertaken with great passion, I suppose it must have occurred to you that the first sight of this, while one is in the condition of the observer, must be very frightening in the condition of the observer, the thought that there is no passage.



K: No. But you see I never looked at it that way.



A: Please tell me how you looked at it. Please.



K: From childhood I never thought I was a Hindu.



A: I see.



K: I never thought, when I was educated in England and all the rest of it, that I was European. I never was caught in that trap. I don't know how it happened, I was never caught in that trap.



A: Well, when you were quite little then and your playmates said to you, well now look, you are a Hindu, what did you say?



K: I probably put on Hinduism and all the trappings of Brahmin, tradition, but it never penetrated deeply.



A: As we say in the vernacular, it never got to you.



K: It never got to me, that's right.



A: I see. That's very remarkable. That's extraordinary. The vast number of people in the world seem to have been got to in respect this.



K: That's why I think, you see, propaganda has become the means of change.



A: Yes. Yes.



K: Propaganda is not truth. Repetition is not truth.



A: It's a form of violence too.



K: That's just it. So a mind that merely observes doesn't react to what it observes according to its conditioning. Which means there is no observer at anytime, therefore no division. It happened to me, I don't know how it happened, but it has happened. And in observing all this I've seen in every human relationship, every kind of human relationship, there is this division and therefore violence. And to me the very essence of non-relationship is the factor of me and you.



A: I was just trying to go back in my own personal history and think of when I was a child. I did, while accepting that I was different - I did believe that, I did come to accept that - there was something else however that always held me very, very hard to centre in terms of making an ultimate issue of that, and that was an experience I had when I was rowing a boat. I spent some time in Scandinavia as a child and I used to take a boat out on the fjord everyday, and when I would row I was profoundly moved by the action of the water when I moved the oar, because I lifted the oar out of the water, and there was a separation in substance between the water and the oar, but the water which was necessary for support and for purchase so that I could propel myself, never lost touch with itself, it always turned into itself without every having left itself in the beginning. And once in awhile I would laugh at myself and say, if anyone catches you looking at this water any longer than you are doing they will think that you are clear out of your mind. This is the observer talking to himself, of course. But that made such a profound impression on me that I think, it was what you might call a little salvation for me, and I never lost that. So maybe there is some relationship between that apprehension which I think changed my being, and what it is you are talking about as one who never ever suffered this sense of separation at all. Please go ahead.



K: This brings us to the point sir, doesn't it, can the human mind which has evolved in separation, in fragmentation...



A: This is where evolution is. Yes.



K: ...can such a mind transform, undergo a regeneration which is not produced by influence, by propaganda, by threat and punishment, because if it changes because it is going to get a reward then...



A: It hasn't changed.



K: ...it hasn't changed.



A: No.



K: So that is one of the fundamental things which one has to ask and answer it in action, not in words.



A: In action. Oh yes.



K: Which is, my mind, the human mind has evolved in contradiction, in duality. The 'me' and the 'not me' has evolved in this traditional cleavage, division, fragmentation. Now can that mind observe this fact, observe without the observer, and only then there is a regeneration. As long as there is an observer observing this then there is a conflict. I don't know if I make myself clear.



A: Yes, you do. You make yourself very clear on two levels. On the level of discourse alone, which I know is not your major concern, on a level of discourse alone it necessarily follows that it must be the case that this possibility exists, otherwise we would be talking nonsense. But then the agony of the situation at large that we have been describing is simply that whether this can be done or not never occurs to a person and in the absence of it even occurring the repetition is going to continue indefinitely and things are going to get worse and worse.



K: Sir, the difficulty is most people won't even listen.



A: I'm sighing. I know that.



K: Won't listen. If they do listen they listen with their conclusions. If I am a Communist I will listen to you up to a point. After that I won't listen to you. And if I am slightly demented I will listen to you and translate what I hear according to my dementia.



A: Exactly



K: So one has to be extraordinarily serious to listen. Serious in the sense put aside my peculiar prejudices and idiosyncrasies and listen to what you are saying, because the listening is the miracle: not what shall I do with what you have said.



A: Not what shall I listen to...



K: But the act of listening.



A: But the act of listening itself.



K: Yes.



A: We are back to 'ing', where there's listening itself.



K: That requires that you are good enough to listen to me because you want to find out. But the vast majority say what are you talking about, I want to go on enjoying myself so go and talk to somebody else. So to create an atmosphere, to create an ambience, a feeling that life is dreadfully serious, my friend, do listen. It's your life, don't waste it, do listen. To bring about a human being that will listen is the greatest importance, because we don't want to listen. It's too disturbing.



A: I understand. I have tried sometimes in class to make this very point. And sometimes I suggest that we should watch the animal, especially the wild animal, because if it's not listening it's likely dead.



K: Dead, yes sir.



A: There is this extraordinary attention that it makes and every instant of its life is a crisis.



K: Absolutely.



A: And you know what happens, the eyes out there show in the main that they think I am talking about animal psychology. I'm not talking about psychology at all, I'm talking about what is the case which is either or, and there isn't any way to get from either to or. That's what I mean. So I think I understand you.



K: In America what is happening how, as I observe it, I may be mistaken, they are not serious. They are playing with new things, something entertaining, go from one thing to the other. And they think this is searching.



A: Searching!



K: Searching, asking, but they get trapped in each one of them.



A: Yes.



K: And at the end of it they have nothing but ashes. So it is becoming more and more difficult for human beings to be serious, to listen, to see what they are, not what they should be.



A: No. What is the case.



K: What is.



A: Exactly.



K: That means you please do listen for 5 minutes.



A: Yes.



K: In this conversation you are listening because you are interested, you want to find out. But the vast majority of people say, for god's sake, leave me alone, I have my little house, my wife, my car, my yacht, or whatever it is, for god's sake don't change anything as long as I live.



A: You know, going back to what I do know something about, namely the Academy, because I am situated there in terms of day to day activity. I've often remarked to myself in attending conferences where papers are read that nobody is listening. It's one long monologue. And after a while you get the feeling that it really is a shocking waste of time. And even to sit down and have coffee the discussion say between classes usually runs on the basis of babble, we are just talking about things in which we are not genuinely interested in, in order to fill up space. This, however, is far more serious a matter than simply a description of what's going on.



K: It's a matter, I feel, of life and death.



A: Exactly.



K: If the house is burning I've got to do something. It isn't, I am going to discuss who burned the house.



A: No. No.



K: What colour his hair was, whether it was black or white or purple, I want to put that fire out.



A: Or if such and such had not happened the house would not be burning. I know, I know.



K: And I feel it is so urgent because I see it in India, I see in Europe and America, everywhere I go this sense of slackness, sense of, you know, sense of despair, sense of hopeless activity that is going on.



So to come back to what we are saying, relationship is the highest importance. When in that relationship there is conflict, we produce a society which will further that conflict, through education, through national sovereignties, through all the rest of it that is going on in the world. So a serious man, serious in the sense who is really concerned, committed, must give his total attention to this question of relationship, freedom and knowledge.



A: If I've heard you correctly, and I don't mean by that words that have passed between us, but if I have truly heard you, I've heard something very terrifying, that this disorder that we have in part described, has a built in necessity in it. As long as it persists it can never change. It can never change.



K: Obviously.



A: Any modification of it is...



K: Further disorder.



A: ...is more of the same.



K: More of the same.



A: More of the same. I have the feeling and I hope I have understood you correctly, that there is a relationship between the starkness of this necessity and the fact that there cannot be a gradual progress, or, as a philosopher would put it, something like essential progress, but nevertheless there is some demonic progress that takes place within this disorder that is not so much a progress as it is a proliferation of the same. Necessarily so. Is that what you have been saying?



K: Yes, yes.



A: Necessarily so.



K: You know that word progress, I was told the other day meant, entering into enemy's country fully armed.



A: Really! Progress is entering into an enemy's country fully armed. Dear me.



K: Sir. This is what is happening.



A: I know. Next time we converse, next time, I would like very much if you would be good enough to pursue precisely what we have just come to: namely this necessity and the necessity that produced that statement.



K: Yes, quite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000965-98385c5c8e6d53fda65f072e916f6067.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007422 00000000000 015011  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Scotland's defeated unionist MPs are struggling to get jobs as their networks north of the border shrink.

Many of the 40 Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians culled in May's general election SNP tsunami have retired.

But others are finding it hard to find work as their skills and contacts, once regarded as post-politics gold dust, no longer have much commercial value.

In a Herald survey of defeated or retired MPs to find out what they are now doing, only four expressed a desire to return to elected politics.

Anne Begg, the former Labour MP for Aberdeen South, stressed the sheer number of livelihoods lost in the May tsunami, and not just for MPs, but for their staffs.

"If a factory had closed with so many job losses, we would have had our own government task force," she said. "As it is, there is nothing."

She, aged 60 and disabled, is now in a new world with no plans to do full-time work.

Many other former Westminster politicians privately admit a sometimes exhausting independence referendum and election campaign left them without the networks in Tory-ruled London or SNP-run Edinburgh they can pitch to future employers.

Want to read more? Here is the The Herald view on this story.

Edinburgh West's former Liberal Democrat MP Mike Crockart is officially dabbling with consultancy.

However, the former systems manager and police officer, still a few months shy of 50, wants a proper job that reflects his life-long interest in public service.

But such posts, in charities or campaigns, are few and far between.

There are scores of other unemployed or underemployed former Labour politicians or Liberal figures chasing the same jobs.

Mr Crockart said: "I have no immediate intentions of running again.

"But some employers are worried.

"They think 'Will you not be running again?'

"They want to know if you will stick it out or go for a seat again.'

He has readied himself for a potential run if there is a by-election in his constituency, currently held by scandal-hit nationalist Michelle Thomson.

Ms Thomson has resigned the SNP whip as police investigate her alleged property dealings.

Mr Crockhart said: "I think the transition out of politics has been harder than the transition in.

"It has been hard. But I managed to get my first long holiday with my two sons in five years - to Boston and Cape Cod. And then we bought a beagle, called Alfie, after Batman's butler.

"So I have had time to walk the dog, think and spend more time with my family."

In a divided Scotland, public organisations and charities, he suggests, sometimes want executives who have not quite so clearly nailed their masts to one side. Not least, observers add and Mr Crockart hints, the side that may have lost the war but won the peace, the SNP.

“I think the skills are more important," the former MP said. "But being in the wrong party can be seen as a block. Scotland is a small country."

Academics have previously looked at the employment destinations of MPs - usually to track just how lucrative their work becomes after politics. Few ex-MPs in Scotland have fallen on their feet.

They include former Chancellor Alistair Darling, Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Labour election strategist Douglas Alexander.

Others have not. Jim Murphy, thought to be dabbling with consultancy, was described by a colleague as being "unemployable in Scotland".

Professor Paul Cairney of Stirling University said: "For generations there has always been plenty of work for Scotland's former politicians.

Pates of Des Moines urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would legalize medical marijuana.

In a letter April 26 to House and Senate members, Bishop Pates said a comprehensive bill was needed to “give Iowans the ability to produce a safe and consistent treatment as well as provide a legal avenue for physicians to recommend it to those who are in need.”

It is legal in Iowa for people who suffer from epilepsy to use cannabis oil under a 2014 law approved by legislators. No other illnesses are covered by the law.

However, Iowans with epilepsy cannot legally obtain the medical cannabis in the state because legislators have not approved allowing for its production and distribution. Patients also cannot bring medical cannabis from other states without breaking federal laws.

Bishop Pates reached his decision after visiting several people suffering from chronic, painful conditions who would benefit significantly from medical cannabis and having been contacted by several Iowa legislators. In the letter, he wrote that making the drug available for those who need it for medicinal purposes is a humanitarian issue, particularly during this Jubilee Year of Mercy initiated by Pope Francis.

“As the bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Des Moines, I join the 78 percent of Iowans who believe that medical cannabis should be legally produced, distributed and possessed in Iowa for humanitarian purposes to provide relief for those who are sick and suffering,” he wrote.

A recent Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed 78 percent of adults in Iowa approve of the use of medical marijuana.

“I support this extension of palliative care among this sector of hurting people,” Bishop Pates said.

The legislative proposals have failed so far and legislators have engaged in intense debates on the issue as the final days of the 2016 session wind down. One proposal would have expanded the number of illnesses for which cannabis could have been used. Another would have allowed the state to grow cannabis and produce an oil for medicinal purposes.

“I believe now is the time to help suffering Iowans and their families get legal access to this medicine,” the bishop concluded in his letter.

Twenty-four states allow cannabis oil for medicinal purposes.

The idea that Donald Trump is now inexorably on a path to impeachment has taken almost gleeful hold in the wake of the Michael Flynn resignation among liberal elites and anti-Trumpers generally—and everybody better stop and take a deep breath and consider what might arise from this. This isn’t fire we’re playing with, it’s a nuclear war.

That Trump might somehow be deus-ex-machina-ed out of public life has been a consistent feature of the past 20 months. He won’t run gave way to He’s only in it for the publicity to He only wants to show Obama he’s not to be trifled with but he doesn’t want to be president so he’ll drop out to We’ll deny him a first-ballot victory at the convention and then the party pooh-bahs can take over and find a new candidate to His poll numbers are so bad he’ll quit and let Mike Pence run against Hillary to The Access Hollywood tape will finally do him in…and then he won. Now that he’s president, the question I’m asked constantly is “will he serve out his first term.” The wish is father to the hope here; only the vilest and most monstrous of crimes has led to a negative answer to that question (save in the case of the first President Harrison, who caught a cold from not wearing a coat on Inauguration Day in 1841 and died a month later). No one has ever willingly or voluntarily given up the presidency.

The dream of his self-willed departure is just that—a dream. Which then leads to the question of whether his behavior or choices or emoluments will lead to his impeachment and removal from office. Remember, impeachment is not removal. It is an indictment of the president, brought about by a vote of the House of Representatives, which then refers the case to the Senate. The Senate tries the case and can only remove the president from office with a two-thirds vote.

Presidents have twice been impeached (Johnson, Clinton) and neither was removed. Nixon resigned but that was to avoid his impeachment, which would surely have led to his removal.

Let’s play with this scenario for the moment. The only way Trump will be impeached—by a Republican House!—is if there is unshakable, inarguable, and (forgive me) unimpeachable evidence that he has committed a crime as president. The Constitution requires this, actually; he must be accused of treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors. He has to have done something specific. He must, in effect, be charged. How on earth could this happen when Republicans hold a 50-seat majority in the House? Even if he mugs an old lady on Pennsylvania Avenue, it’s hard to see that happening sheerly as a matter of politics unless something catastrophic happens to his poll numbers. By which I mean, he needs to have become so overwhelmingly unpopular already that Republicans in the House who come from districts Trump won need to know that their constituents will not punish them for voting to impeach.

By catastrophic, I mean his numbers have to go lower than anyone’s have ever gone—lower than Bush’s in late 2008, lower than Carter’s in the summer of 1979, lower than Nixon’s in the summer of 1974.

And even so—even so—unless the evidence is beyond question and beyond all argument, this is an incredibly dangerous thing for people to be speculating about openly. Already pro-Trump voices on the right are calling the leaks that led to Michael Flynn’s firing evidence of an attempted coup d’etat. The fevered use of such terms is part and parcel of the way in which social media amplifies the melodrama of daily news stories.

I am myself unnerved by the evidence of high-level lawlessness in the Flynn matter, but a “coup d’etat” refers specifically to a military ouster of a leader, not a leak-driven campaign using the press to nail someone. This is sure to persist, though, if the Flynn-Russia matter accelerates—and if the reluctant House and Senate do begin investigating the matter in earnest. If the language surrounding the investigation remains florid and purple, if Democrats try to please their Trump-hating constituents by screaming impeachment and liberal media tries to garner audience by jumping openly and vociferously on the bandwagon, the Trumpians will respond in kind by stirring the pot through their media and their argumentation.

The result might well be violence. Not rhetorical violence. Actual violence. Actual political violence. Actual conflicts between anti-Trumpers and Trumpers. At demonstrations. In the streets. Of our cities. Political violence of a sort we haven’t seen in 50 years, and maybe haven’t really seen in this country in the modern era. Those who believe Trump is a unique menace whose threat to our democratic way of life will be met with those who believe the elites are using illicit means to oust the legitimately elected president of the United States.

This is not a fantasy. This is one possible future. And every rational person who cares about the future of the country should be mindful of it, and should work to forestall it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0000928-046fc38ee772dbf106c6a79573022eab.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004144 00000000000 015110  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Jeff Dudgeon and Julie Ann Corr have been elected into Belfast City Council, to make up a total of three LGBT councillors representing Belfast, Northern Ireland

Two newly-elected LGBT councillors will make up Belfast City Council in Northern Ireland.

Jeff Dudgeon and Julie Ann Corr will join returning councillor Mary Ellen Campbell on the city council; between the three of them they will represent the Ulster Unionist Party, the Progressive Unionist Party and Sinn Fein respectively.

Jeff Dudgeon, who represents the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), is openly gay and credited with fighting for homosexuality to be decriminalized in Northern Ireland.

Dudgeon complained to the European Commission of Human Rights after being interrogated about his sexuality, upon which the commission agreed Northern Ireland was in violation of human rights for making gay sex a crime.

As a result of this, homosexuality was decriminalized in Northern Ireland in 1982.

In 2012, Dudgeon was awarded an MBE for his work in the LGBT community in Northern Ireland.

Dudgeon told the Belfast Telegraph he does not know his fellow LGBT councillors but is looking forward to see if they can work together on particular issues.

Joining him is Julie Ann Corr, who represents the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and is openly lesbian.

‘Thank you for all of your warm messages of support, I am delighted & looking forward to taking a seat at BCC representing W/C communities,’ she tweeted.

Corr, who represents Oldpark in north Belfast, also said she does not want her sexuality to be the focus of her politics.

‘Whilst I am open about my sexuality, I will not let it define me or allow anyone to fit me into a neat category,’ she said.

Lesbian councillor Mary Ellen Campbell, of Sinn Fein, believes the newly-elected councillors are a sign of changing attitudes in Northern Ireland.

‘Aren’t the electorate amazing… Imagine no longer the only gay in the village #equality,’ she tweeted.

Twitter user @gaygael also thought the electorates deserved to be congratulated.

‘Two lgb women and a gay man on bcc! Times are a changing,’ they wrote.

Thanksgiving is here again in the States and, although I was not brought up with it and often barely eat more than a tofurkey sandwich unless people invite me over (hint?!), it has become my favorite holiday. People everywhere stop to count their blessings, and this makes them feel grateful and appreciative, so it is a good day. (Not for turkeys, however, not a good day for them at all. I don’t like the role that turkeys are forced to play. So p’raps don’t invite me over for the meal part after all… or the football… but the rest of it, yeah!)

Back in the day, from what I’m told, the first settlers gave thanks for good harvests. Nowadays most of us are a good deal more removed from the source of our food, which means that what it takes to get food onto our plates every day is hidden from us unless we really stop to think about it. But although I may not be thinking about the background of my frozen peas as I plop them in the pan and then gobble them down with my tofurkey, I am just as dependent on those who planted, grew, harvested, packaged and delivered my food as the early settlers were. In fact, the chances are that these days a good deal more people are involved in the process of getting food into my stomach to sustain my life for another 24 hours. On Thanksgiving we have a better chance of remembering this, and the thought pleases us for we feel supported.

I’d like to have Thanksgiving every day (no turkey, no football, no lines at the airport, but the good bits!). And I can, there is nothing stopping me. For one thing, I can remember how lucky I am to have this precious human life. For another, I can remember how this precious human life and every single one of my needs and enjoyments come from the kindness of others.

Lucky me

In the meditation on our precious human life we count our blessings because this life is right now giving us an unprecedented opportunity to make serious spiritual progress even on a daily basis, yet it is so almost unbelievably rare — a fact that becomes obvious if we compare our situation to that of most other living beings. Even the simplest things in life are precious, such as being able to walk or talk or write or taste, something we often don’t realize until we no longer have them due to sickness, disability or death. Traditionally in Buddhism we count 18 blessings, called the eight freedoms and the ten endowments – chances are you have every one of these (if you want to know for sure, you can c heck out Joyful Path of Good Fortune.

Don’t let this be true for you: “You don’t know what you’ve got till its gone.”

Thanks to others!

Then in the kindness of others meditation we contemplate in as much personal detail as we can where exactly each of these blessings comes from?! Quick answer: Others.

Geshe Kelsang says:

Our body is the result not only of our parents but of countless beings who have provided it with food, shelter and so forth. It is because we have this present body with human faculties that we are able to enjoy all the pleasures and opportunities of human life… Our skills and abilities all come from the kindness of others—we had to be taught how to eat, how to walk, how to talk, and how to read and write… Our spiritual development and the pure happiness of full enlightenment also depend on the kindness of living beings. ~ Transform Your Life

Great full

Remembering all this makes us feel grateful. We feel “full” for all that is “great”! We need gratitude to feel good about our lives and also as a foundation for love and compassion for others. Whenever we recall any kindness someone has shown us, studies and our own experience show that we feel instantly better, and closer to them. (A 15th century etymology for gratitude is “pleasing to the mind”). Gratitude predisposes us to many positive states of mind. So when we take a little time to itemize all the kindness we have received since the day we were born, we can overflow with happiness! As we fill up with happiness, it seems to push all our negative, selfish minds out, for there isn’t room for both – like scum being pushed out the top of a bottle when we fill it up with clean liquid.

On the other hand, when we feel depleted, exhausted or ungrateful it is easy for the negative moods to settle in. We feel we are lacking something, hollow, and project that on the world around us, which feels bereft of happiness and support. We can develop attachment for external objects to fill us up, and if we see others’ experiencing good things we can easily feel envy for the things we feel we don’t have.

“Hang on a minute”, I hear some of you say. “I don’t have that much to be thankful for – my life is in fact a huge mess and it is all their fault.” If we find ourselves pursuing this depressing line of thought, we can go back to the precious human life meditation. To be able to even think about these things means we must have a precious human life – so with that established we can stop dwelling on what is wrong with our lives and instead remember everything we have going for us. Then we can ask ourselves where each of our freedoms and opportunities actually comes from. (Answer above!)

We choose what we think about, so we might as well choose to smell the roses rather than stick our nose in the stinky garbage can.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Please give this article to anyone who might like it.

In Sweden, a person suspected of a serious crime can be detained before trial with the approval of a court if there is a risk that they will flee prosecution, obstruct the investigation or continue to commit crimes.

Uppsala District Court has set a detention hearing time for the men between 1pm and 3pm on Wednesday. The defence lawyer for one of the suspects said his client denies all accusations.

"I'm going to insist on my client being released because he denies all the accusations," Andreas Welin told news agency TT.

The lawyer would not elaborate on how his client explains the course of events.

Witnesses reported alerting the police as they saw abuse streamed live in a closed Facebook group of 60,000 members. Police arrested the men upon arriving at the apartment, where they were still present along with the woman.

All three men were initially suspected of rape, but the prosecutor has requested that two of them be remanded in custody on suspicion of rape, and the third on suspicion of failure to reveal rape. All are now suspected according to the stronger degree of suspicion in Swedish law, "probable cause".

Uppsala’s deputy chief prosecutor Magnus Berggren told The Local on Tuesday that investigators had been able to get hold of certain still images and footage, but were still working to find the particular video sequence allegedly showing the rape. Appeals have been put out for anyone in possession of it to get in touch with authorities, while Facebook were also asked to retrieve the video.

"In order to get as a clear a picture as possible we are questioning people who have at least seen parts of the live streaming on Facebook," Berggren said.

"A film would of course have been central evidence, but there is also other evidence," he added.

The suspects were born in 1992, 1996 and 1998, which makes them younger than the woman, who was born in 1986.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0000865-418f73253906c3f82934af7339dc733b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002371 00000000000 014627  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The lineup for the Metal Insider-sponsored GWAR-B-Q is already stacked, but it’s just gotten even more impressive. Misfits have just been announced as the special secret guest for the event, taking place on August 16th. That means that if you’re a VIP ticketholder, you’ll get to meet Jerry Only at the Meet and Meat. If you’re not a VIP ticketholder, you can still win a pair of VIP passes courtesy of us even though it’s sold out. In somewhat more somber news, the master of ceremonies for the Dave Brockie Memorial has been named, and it will be none other than Dead Kennedys frontman and punk legend Jello Biafra. The press release promises a Viking funeral set ablaze upon the SS Boat.

In addition to the Misfits and GWAR, Body Count, Hatebreed, Bam Margera’s Fuckface Unstoppable, Goatwhore, Iron Reagan, Revocation, Noisem, Occultist, The Meatmen, Kepone, Loincloth and Eat the Turnbuckle will also be playing the event, which kicks off at 10:30 AM on August 16th. The B4BQ will take place on the 15th right after the memorial, with The Black Dahlia Murder, Mobile Deathcamp, Gritter, Venomous Maximus and The Attack playing. If you haven’t gotten your tickets yet, you can do that here, but don’t forget to enter to win sold-out VIP passes, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0000500-e1804cd3d10ef04c0d97da73e34b7976.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000023062 00000000000 015073  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Date suspended Suspension length Name Position Team at the time of suspension Reason Reference

Wrote a piece for FoxSports.com Saturday regarding the ballyhooed Ric Flair/Carolina Panther/49ers controversy in respect of it being a pro wrestling angle.

If this link doesn't work it's easily found on the FoxSports.com site in the Buzz section or the NFL section.

I have not yet signed with Fox but we are obviously close and are hopeful that we can finalize the contract next week. Fox provides an amazing platform for creative work and for the many projects that I am working on during the most unretired time of my life.

Fox has some potentially, amazing creative ideas for me of which I hope that we get to collaborate on sooner than later.

Brainstormed with Peter Rosenberg today of Hot 97 in NYC who will MC my two, NYC shows on Saturday March 1 at the Gramercy Theater. Tickets are available now but are selling quickly at the Gramercy box office and via all ticketmaster.com outlets.

I'm told that we will finalize our NOLA dates for 'RINGSIDE' during WM30 week this Monday. It looks as if the House of Blues will be our venue.The day and times are still to be finalized as well as when tickets will go on sale of which I hope will be in the next few days. If you are coming to WM30 please plan on attending one of our shows.

We had some very productive creative meetings this week about the format of my upcoming podcast for Podcast One. I think that you are going to like what we are planning on doing as it is very interactive.Our Podcast One venture will start in mid February.

Been asked by WWE to be a part of the upcoming Paul Heyman DVD of which I'm anxious to participate. Once details are worked out we will schedule a time for me to head to WWE HQ and tell a few...dozen Heyman stories. I'm very honored to have been requested to be a part of this production as it was me who gave Paul his first broadcast gig and taught him the ropes as best that I could . Paul was so high strung and outspoken that many within WCW did not want to work with him but I saw talent in the abrasive albeit highly intelligent Jewish kid from Scarsdale, N.Y.

Many fans think that our broadcast of WM17 may have been the best broadcasted 'Mania to date. The credit for that show goes to the amazing talents who raised the bar that night in the Astrodome. But Paul was at his best that night.

The Q&A's are updated here and unfortunately many did not make the cut. I read them all but there were too many duplicates and some folks were merely asking questions to get a response....any response. I really like, smart, succinct questions and please don't submit them multiple times in the same sitting.

You are invited to follow me on Twitter where we are over 1M strong and growing every day @JRsBBQ.

I never dreamed "retirement" could be so busy. :)

Though American forces effectively defeated the Filipinos in April 1902, President Teddy Roosevelt waited until July 4, 1902, to declare victory. That's right: the U.S. celebrated independence day that year by taking away the independence of another country; perhaps an early sign that America was not suited for colonialism. But it gave the thousands of American soldiers still in the Philippines two reasons to celebrate the Fourth. In Manila, the 30th U.S. Infantry Regiment held a parade to mark them both.

That same week, the U.S. Congress passed the Philippine Organic Act, which engineered the colonial Philippines' government as a semi-democratic, joint American-Filipino body. The legislature was split between a "Philippine Commission" of White House appointees and a less powerful "Philippine Legislature" of elected Filipinos. But overseeing them both was a Governor-General, hand-picked by the U.S. president. The first Governor-General was William Howard Taft. So, even if actual Filipinos did not observe the Fourth of July, their government certainly did.

But a number of Americans were uneasy with the colonial effort, among them The Atlantic, which that month published a long meditation on the contradiction of celebrating the Fourth of July while revoking another country's independence, and on "the attempts we are making to impose that organization by force upon Asiatic peoples." The unsigned piece argued, "It is plain enough now that we are holding the Philippines by physical force only, and that the brave and unselfish men we have sent there have been assigned to a task which is not only repellent to Americans, but bitterly resented by the supposed beneficiaries of our action." The magazine that had opposed slavery less than 50 years earlier, like many Americans, found colonialism a poor fit.

After five years -- the same time span between the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the 2008 election of a presidential candidate who had opposed the war -- President Roosevelt and his government began to give in to public pressure. "We shall have to be prepared for giving the islands independence of a more or less complete type much sooner than I think advisable," Roosevelt said that year. In Congress, Democrats began discussing a bill to re-write the Philippine Organic Act, giving the Philippines a more independent government and, eventually, actual independence. But Republicans held a majority in the Senate and, in 1908, the former Governor-General of the colony, William Howard Taft, was elected president. Independence would have to wait.

In 1912, President Taft was defeated by Woodrow Wilson, who supported the Democrats' plan. A few months after Wilson took office, the House of Representatives passed a bill with his backing that replaced the Philippines' White House-appointed legislature with a native, democratic one, and made the eventual independence of the island nation official U.S. policy. But negotiations in the Senate took years, and Wilson did not sign it into law until 1916.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0000940-e480f18d3d818ed740184ea515725a5d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000070024 00000000000 014750  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Hi! I had the honor of attending the closed loketest on 8/24, so here’s everything I remember. The information on every character except for Izayoi is pretty sparse, but pay attention to the system mechanics! This isn’t super professional, and I don’t have a lot to say about a lot of the characters, but here’s what I can remember, hopefully it helps!

You can catch videos of the loketest red vs white tournament here:

Who is that red izayoi player who really can’t get over one of Izayoi’s main gatlings being gone??? HMMMMMMMMM???

System

———-

The game feels pretty similar to CP (So if you are trying to hold out for CF, play CP right now) with refinements, so it does feel rather fresh despite having a lot of familiarity. The hitsparks aren’t nearly as obnoxious as they are in vid and the game/hud look much nicer in person. A lot of things are reanimated, voice clips redone, etc.

Crush Triggers: Crush triggers are much faster, and have changed from 30f startup to what feels like (sub?) 20f startup (Maybe 17? Might be pushing it, but it is quite fast). This is BIG, and gives a lot of characters pretty stable ways of opening people up. Unfortunately, short charge crush triggers push back SUPER far on guard break, and don’t offer a ton of frame advantage. The amount of frame advantage seems to differ character by character, where Izayoi could combo off of hers but Naoto couldn’t. Not SURE about the frame advantage on block, but the recovery didn’t seem quite different, so I didn’t bother to look into it. It does let more characters work CT into their combos for sure. This is great for resource characters, where just the untechable time lets them structure better combos. For 25 meter!!! Longer holds offer more break time it seems, making the charge actually useful. It also causes proration on hit to increase, where an immediate crush trigger would scale the combo a bit more (seems to offer the same hitstun though). Overall, it seems like most characters can really only combo off of guard break in the corner with no charge, but honestly that seems to be enough. There’s a big threat that 25 meter poses in the corner, and it provides a great way to target barrier usage. I definitely definitely like this change.

OD: OD times might be more standardized (seems pretty short, maybe I feel this way because of JCCOD change), but it’s just a hunch. I haven’t looked into that so explicitly. Doing ODC or ODGC yield half of the full overdrive duration, and and OD inputs done while the opponent is in hitstun cause ODC state (so no more JCCOD). My hunch is that all OD’s start at 4 seconds, and cap out at 8 seconds at lower life.

Combo Timer: Seems shorter, or Izayoi’s starter ratings may have shifted around. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure, so take this with a grain of salt. I definitely feel like the latter is likely, but I have seen things that have hinted towards both being true. Untechable values may have been shifted around across the board, but combos are definitely looking shorter as caused by character changes or system changes.

Barrier + Throw: I’ve heard that barrier will universally push people out of 2A canceled into throw range on block. It definitely applies to some characters, as Izayoi I could no longer do dash 2A Throw. Some were saying barrier pushback felt increased, but it doesn’t really (only) feel that way to me. Throw range looks much smaller on the ground, which could cause that. Vaccum airthrow still exists, lol.

General: The game feels a bit faster. Maybe hitstop reduction? Not sure how to test that out, there could be a couple of things that factor into this. A bunch of characters move/dash noticeably faster. Not totally sure on this (no real way to test this), but it seriously felt quicker on hits, so i’m heavily leaning towards hitstop reduction. Also, damage counter numbers turn red when you get a damage buff from either active flow, or counterhit.

Exceed: >Exceed is a new mechanic to CF! It’s like a meterless super you get while in OD. All of them are single attacks that perform a short animation on hit, but don’t complete on block or whiff. They all have a blue “flash” on their usage.

~2k normally, 4k in active flow. Didn’t really check the min damage, but it doesn’t really seem so high. I’ve seen it do ~300 damage, so it can’t be all that much. Honestly, kind of weird? Couldn’t really find a place to use it well to increase damage, I was almost always better off just doing a good ODC combo. In any case, cancels off of normals, but it’s sorta slow. Maybe around the same speed as crush trigger. Ends your OD immediately. Can function well as a reversal, because it doesn’t have a superflash. I’ve heard theyre rather safe on block, but it may vary character to character.

Active Flow: >Active flow is a new mechanic to CF that is somewhat like vorpal from UNI, but it isn’t a tug of war type deal. Your character’s active flow level is independent of the other character. You get it from performing good actions like teching throws, using invuln to go through attacks, blocking well, pressuring, hitting your opponent…you get the idea. You get it for playing well, and it grants you speedy burst regeneration and a 10% base damage bonus for ~10 seconds. If your burst is full, your Exceed super gets really buffed, having twice as much base damage.

Biggest advantage is increasing your rate of burst regen imo. If you think you can get it, it makes using your burst quickly useful. Or even popping OD before you get into active flow, so you can use the exceed damage buff. Damage increase otherwise seems kind of negligible. Pretty hard to keep track of, feels like something that kind of just “happens”. I didn’t really get to plan around when happens to take advantage of the properties. Kind of just comes and goes, so it compliments a general approach like “i’ll confirm with my burst, so that I can put myself in an advantaged position early and use active flow to regain my burst” but that goes out the window if your opponent bursts too so its like…okay.

Active Flow Applied (Taken from a post I made on DL):

currently, using OD early and getting your burst back was fairly easy, but now this benefits you from an offensive standpoint, as getting your burst back off an early OD (not 100%) involved wagering some risk/reward (defending, or even getting hit), and if you won the round decisively you’d end up with less burst than your opponent by the start of the next round, lol. but in CF, killing someone quickly off an OD confirm pretty much means you get your burst back by the start of the next round, or you can use your OD to kill them if necessary. Active flow mostly ties into burst management, which is why I stressed the importance on burst recovery over damage boost.

You can kind of just feel it out, as “if i play well, ill have more chances to use my burst” because the ways to get it are so flexible.

Using your OD early for a good confirm is a good idea because you contribute to your active flow counter, and hopefully maintain an advantaged position. Even if they burst, the burst differential is not only 30%, but you’ve already chalked up some active flow, meaning you’re that much closer to getting into a heavily advantaged position, but more importantly, if you get hit, as long as you can defend well you are likely to get your burst back quickly.

But you have to keep in mind where your opponent’s active flow is too. If they burst, then just go into active flow and get half of their burst back, it wasn’t really worth it to trade bursts, because the chance of you benefiting from the trade is much lower depending on where active flow is. Even if you get into active flow, get OD, and hit them, they get another burst back. You want to make the most of the chances you take and when you do land a hit, you want to either create a situation where you can easily call heavy momentum without burst interfering on that hit, or your next hit (early OD).

And OD timers are standardized this time around so doing burst safe combos is pretty hard. Burst has also been buffed to where it’s active frames catch some forms of invuln (led ley, maybe izayoi aegis, etc), so they DO want burst to be a good option too. Overall, OD plays a big role in conjunction with active flow.

It’s honestly pretty easy to just think of it as top player privilege to get more burst atm, lol. But theyre definitely aware of the feelings that go into it and want to change it accordingly, so maybe the mechanic might change a bit by the time the game is released. It definitely just happens if you play well, lol.

Characters named Naoto, Hibiki, or Izayoi:

———-

Naoto and Hibiki Impressions:

Hibiki…long story short, Hibiki looks “OK”. Very underwhelming, leaves much to be desired as far as offense goes I think. Seems pretty tricky in neutral and some cool normals / approach, but I definitely need to see a lot more before I’m impressed. I don’t really have a lot to say, he kind of just does things lol. Not sure how he’s supposed to be played, I guess tricky neutral? I could offer a writeup on his tools and stuff, but someone could definitely do a better job than me. Overall though, my impression is that his offense seems kind of limited. He does have a teleport that covers a lot of space, and tools that cover good ranges, so he’s not so limited against characters with ranged tools. A high jump, big air normals, but overall dont add up to much at the moment. Damage and conversions seem alright, but he’s a bit overshadowed by what i saw from Naoto.

Naoto looks solid from the jump. Huge hitboxes, good frame adv, normals are good, drive moves are good, great run speed, good airdash distance. crouching AA with hitbox right above him, loooooooooots of invuln on DP. Solid tools for offense when he gets in (Anti air / Standing hitbox unblockable, think muzzle flitter but also catches people jumping). Dash special crossups, freedom with dash cancels, etc. He looks like he has a ton of options when he’s in. Looks like a very versatile brawler character! I’m pretty interested in seeing how he turns out. Seems to do good damage, has good offense, solid neutral tools. Pretty much all he needs, easily visible from the jump.

Izayoi:

General: Normal mode feels faster, again. Dash acceleration on the ground seems to be up. GA is kind of the same, but jump height may have been increased. Here and there, a bunch of things felt ‘faster’ but i’m not sure if theyre actually faster or if its system. Confirms are good ($$$) and there’s a lot of really really broken shit lmao. Izayoi feels…really strong. Better than before, and I already thought she was top. Hopefully the eyes that watched me are merciful and do not nerf her too hard, but I definitely expect to lose some of this stuff. I am sorry if I got this character nerfed.

Combo Rate: Seems to be back to 80% in GA, Not sure about normal mode but it feels like it’s still 80%. So they might have normalized that. But definitely ++ in Gain Art.

Crush Trigger: Off fastest CT, can combo in the corner, but midscreen you need to Phorizer to make up for the range.

6A – Gatlings into 6A removed. Not sure if you can still 6A 5D/2D. Doesn’t force crouch, not sure about bonus proration. I have no clue how to combo into this lol.

6B – SPECIAL CANCELABLE INTO AIR SLASHES (yes, you get a combo for hopping over lows and hitting people with this fucking 24f airborne overhead yes this is wonderful YES FUCK YES)

6C (NM) – Animation is a bit different for the bits, but the move seems the same. Still frame adv on stance cancel.

6C (GA) – ~Neutral on block, much less hitstun now, but jump and special cancelable.

3C (NM) – Izayoi slides forward when you do it now, a la 5C. Cool, could see it being useful.

j236C/j236B/j623B – All generally send the opponent in the same direction, so you really just want to aim at them while confirming air hits. Rather fast, and TK’d Slashes are comboable with jA or 623B or w/e so they do seem pretty good for footsies low to the ground. Izayoi’s momentum stops immediately, so this can also bait some AA’s effectively. Not sure if they run body property though, didn’t test that explicitly. In recovery all the way until she hits the floor, but it isn’t CH. Didn’t notice landing recovery, so it must not be significant. Super super useful for defensive space control. Cancel into Strike Fall and D teleport on hit only.

jA – Not sure, just a hunch but prob back to 7f startup (was 6f in EX).

jB – New animation, Izayoi kicks out horizontally. God hitbox. God normal. High, horizontal space coverage, seems pretty active, comes with a crossup hitbox. Think somewhere between Ragna jB and Ragna jC I guess? It’s fast, far for the speed, not a ton of recovery (more than old jB, but with a hitbox like this it’s fucking good).

jB/2B – Maybe starter rating reduced? Not sure.

236A – Doesn’t move her back as far on the ground. Looks weird, lol. Maybe frame adv has changed? Less pushback means you can use it for midscreen combos, I did get a link off of A saber midscreen.

236B – Less untech time on standing hit, but it’s pretty negligible. Air hit still emergency techable. Can’t whiff cancel into astraea anymore (boo).

236C – More untech time? Or just causes opponent to stay lower to the ground. Causes emergency tech instead of air tech (yay). Can’t whiff cancel into astraea anymore (boo).

623B – Increased hitbox in front of her (harder to low profile) and recovery is no longer counterhit in it’s later frames.

Astraea – Launches super high and super far. Opponent techs in air. Combos into 6C midscreen with no teleport, lol. B teleport lets you cross up and do 5C, which is pretty useful! Crossup Aegis midscreen, lets go? Maybe? In corner, height sets up for …3C 236C~6D 6C 623C 5B all done as fast as possible.

Strike Fall – Retained the mirage thruster cancels, but lost Astraea cancel (you will be missed). Still has a bounce, but it’s back to the old positioning! Your opponent is like, right in front of you when you land. Yay. Might mean midscreen 5A pickup is back, but I only went for Phorizer since I pretty much was running old combos.

236D – God. Big D saber is gone, but it is not missed. New D saber creates 3 small sabers that hang in front of Izayoi, then shoot out after a bit. The angle is like…kind like centered at a ~40 degree angle, but the space coverage is huge. Easy crossups + grimy shit, hilariously strong space control. In the air, it shoots out in a fan as well, but without the hang. in OD, this move is like the actual stupidest thing I have ever seen in BB. it shoots 5 instead of 3, and it is actually just stupid. in the air, anything below or in front of her is just BODIED. If you have one thing to be hype for or pray that it doesn’t get nerfed, it is this. Oh yeah, it costs 1 fucking star.

Phorizer – More recovery, so its easier to punish on block. Still fast as fuck.

Trans AM – We’re back, baby. Maybe. Cooldown is much shorter, but I’m not sure if the old loops from 1.1 are possible. Definitely much better than it was in EX, like from the jump being able to use the bits is so fucking nice. Definitely better than EX. Definitely, definitely better. I’m so glad.

Other obvious stuff i didnt mention: its the same.

Characters not named Naoto, Hibiki, or Izayoi (and my rather weak, limited impressions of them):

———-

Ragna: Seems strong. Nightmare edge seems solid, it doesn’t really have a ton of recovery, but the angle that berial had will be missed. Followup can be RPS’d on block, maybe? Knockdown looks good in front of him, but losing those midscreen confirms could hurt. Followup corner carry is pretty serious. But outside of berial, confirms look good. Dead spike might have less untechable time though, or maybe it’s a result of a combo timer change. Couldn’t tell. 2D Special cancel on block and hit, lol (no longer hits low). Tsuika doesn’t push back as far. GH hit state looks hilarious but it doesnt really affect anything, maybe makes some combos a bit harder/easier. Blood scythe is still pretty whack, but air blood scythe now causes slide and is comboable midscreen and corner (saw 2A pickup in the corner, but crossup blood scythe hit is a thing). Seems like blood scythe replaces berial. Doesn’t really seem that different overall. Combo route changes, slightly safer pressure, but still ragna. IAD DP is still good! Exceed is simple and funny, but i like it.

Jin: Maybe RIP. Lost a lot of cancel options. 5B 6A is gone, 5B throw cancel is gone. But it looks like it has less recovery, so that might be it’s saving grace for pressure usage. 6C 6B might be gone. New air D fireball is pretty funny, though i didnt see a ton of intricate uses. New combo parts with ground 236D flower seem like Ky forcebreak lol. Hits on block are a bit spaced out though, so you can use it for oki much better than you could old ground 236D. New C DP is really fast gets 5A into a pretty decent combo. Much less invuln though, so harder to use to beat other reversals. Still can be used for combos into 5B with the height, though. Ice Car whiff combos are still a thing, but more restrictive. Dash C DP routes work midscreen. New 3C goes far, but has a bit of recovery. Slower, so combos off D DP might be restricted. Looks like he didn’t really get anything super significant. Old confirm potential was already very good, and they just weakened his pressure game. New EX fireball (the ice flowers) seem hard to use as effectively as things like the old j236D. Exceed is like, he freezes you, does a series of attacks and then breaks the ice.

Noel: Still noel, but she looks like she got a ton of new cool things to mash drive on you with. j2C wallbounces in the corner, so she can do stuff like j2C (wallbounce) airdash jB/C blah blah. There are a ton of new drive things that i have absolutely no idea about. 6D is a crazy looking low with a ton of invuln that travels like across the screen, definitely a solid neutral tool. I saw a lot of naked recover drive strings that really looked like they were plus (the reload animations looked HELLA short) but that might be OD only. Reload animations looked short otherwise, but maybe not plus unless in OD. Lost her overhead in drive i think? so it seems like her new drive pressure revolves around frame traps. Not too much to say. Her exceed looked silly, thats all I remember.

Rachel: I did not see ANY RACHEL AND I AM SO SORRY. From what I hear, there were a lot of nerfs ;_;

Amane: New fireball is really important lol (small tornado that runs across the ground). It seems pretty good, and he overall seems a bit better, but maybe not good enough. 3C is slower, but his other C normals look faster with better hitboxes. 6D can be held, and even started traveling on the ground?!?! (apparently this is tracking) It moved pretty fast, lol. Not sure if thats automatic, might end up being a nerf lmao (i wrote this before i heard it tracked, so if it won’t whiff, we’re still in business). Still amane. His exceed is kinda cool, he just does flower things (active flow) and then slams you into the ground with his kimono, sideswaps.

Arakune: I didnt see any arakune.

Azrael: Doesn’t really look very different. Got a DP, but it’s kinda jokey. Hitbox doesn’t seem too great, he does like a knee up or something and then goes flying over you and does a slam very far away. maybe the slam is plus, but it doesnt look like theres any reason to be in that area lol. Slam doesn’t seem to have a hitbox that makes crossups possible. Looks the same, really.

Bang: Didn’t really see any.

Bullet: She seems like she got a lot of good things, she might actually be strong. Her new 5D is fucking huge, a bit slow close up but the range goes super far super quickly. No invlun, but the threat is super useful. Combos into 5D might be rip, but jD is still the same. Miq Cap can be followed up with 5B or 6B in the corner. She got a command throw!!! Praise Be!!! 1k damage and knockdown right in front of her without any heat, comboable for sure at 2 heat (3.5k to 4k?). Not sure about followups at 1 heat. Heat does NOT GO AWAY ON BLOCK YES COOL THANKS. That in conjunction with new 5D might let her actually fucking chase people down, seems kinda crazy tbh. Her exceed is cool, but I don’t really remember what it looks like. I just remember doing it and being like “ok its cool”. New 5D + No Heat Loss + Command Throw definitely seem like a solid ground for her to work with. Heat is much more dangerous than it used to be.

Carl: New Tenezzera looking move seems cool, good for his pressure. Still, seems pretty lacking in terms of high low mixup. Not sure what he can do, I think they took away the doll overhead so he might have a really hard time doing fuzzies and stuff. Aside from that, he still seems to be carl. He came off as a little bit less threatening than he used to be, but the new doll rush move is OK. His new overhead looks like a nerf, lol. Unless he still has his old 6C, i dunno.

Celica: Cool! A lot of new cool things that I dont understand. She looks like she regenerates a lot of HP, but she might have to actually cause herself to lose the hp in some way. I think she can blow HP to put super armor on certain moves like celica upper, and then part of her lifebar turns blue? All I really remember is looking at her regain like 1k and I was like what just happened. Doesn’t really seem to have gotten anything significant in terms of neutral control, but i’m not sure if that was her problem in the first place. If the healing mechanic is good enough, she can get somewhere. General strings and such seem to be stronger though.

CLICA V2: Ok, i learned what she does. Her lifebar has a special blue portion that gets tacked on everytime she lands a drive move. The end of her drive string has a healing move that can be used to regenerate 10% of her max hp at a time. She can spend life to powerup her specials with the doll, and that costs all of her blue recoverable health. Projectile is better, can challenge projectiles now with her new charge, but characters who used to beat her in neutral with good normals…still kind of do. But her conversions off ranged pokes and pressure seems to be a bit better. Along with her healing mechanic, she seems to be able to actually pose a threat on offense.

Hakumen: New counter shoulder tackle thing is really weird, lol. Costs 1 star, and sends him flying with a parry. I think it catches both highs and lows, though. Not sure if it’s frame 1, that would be pretty stupid. On succesful parry you can do the followup, or cancel it into his other specials. Still does the hakumen thing. His exceed is like…he kicks you on the floor and then does Misogi with the sword, lol.

Hazama: He has 2 chains again!! Wow!! Chains on no cancel have less recovery (seem to put you in more blockstun at a closer range than they used to), but they don’t cause stock regen on block (yes. yes. i have waited years for this). A cancel still causes him to lose a stock. He can’t do level 1 moves from stance without doing the new special first (which puts him into stance, but doesn’t have a lot of range, so I dunno) making it very obvious when he can act after going into stance (fuck yeah). Command throw damage is up now, he gets like 2.2kish. Still stance nerf is pretty big lol. Coupled with the stock nerf, I dunno where he’d stand. Big nerfs though, IMO? Fighting against him, those were his most threatening points, so its relieving to see that gone, but it’s funny that his command throw is better than Bullet’s, lol. Gasho (stance flash kick) is also notably slower, and houtenjin doesn’t have any invuln so he’s weaker on defense.

Kagura: I didnt see anything.

Kokonoe: Similar to EX i guess. new spinny move is hilarious, and might actually end up being plus if you do it right? When i blocked it, she was not that negative. She flies to the graviton when you do it, and it kinda looks like aigis megido. Kind of funny if they just whiff it though and you get away from the graviton, lol. New bunker followup where you set the bomb on the opponent and get oki, the bomb explodes after a pretty long time so there should be a bit of setplay that can be structured from it.

Litchi: 6C(2) without staff is soft KD now, less untech time after tsubame too maybe. Didn’t really get to see much :>

Makoto: Didnt get to see much of her either :<

Platinum: Aside from her new item and Mami changes, I couldn’t really tell what was up. New item is a boomerang, she can throw it out and catch it and it will replenish the usage. The throwable arcs are pretty good. One goes straight ahead very fast, and comes back a bit more slowly, the other one thrown from the air is like a hook, going forward and down and traveled back along the ground. Overhead Mami looks faster than it did from the previous loketest, but the arc is the same. Didnt get to see the super boomerang :(

Relius: Maybe RIP? New command throw seems pretty useless lol, pretty slow. jA only hits like 3 times now, gad leis is faster but it seems minus on block. 214A soft kd on more heights now, which is good. 2C less untechable time, combo routes seem a bit more restrictive. ~214C followup to 236C/j236C seems like ass now lol, it sends them straight up and doesn’t wallbounce. Very hard to combo. Unsummoned 214B (is this the overhead) is fast, but summoned 214B is the same. 22A is slower (only 22A, not 22B or 22C), 3C 22A will cover everything except for backroll midscreen, and covers everything in the corner. Blue combo if you don’t tech though, which could be bad depending on combo options to put you back into a knockdown situation. Dunno, nothing really seems so stand out, looks like a lot of nerfs. His exceed is cool, he jojos poses while you get beat up and then he does this cool thing that i dont understand.

Tager: Didnt see any :<

Tao: Only saw one match, she really didnt seem different lol. New jB looks alright.

Tsubaki: New move looks…okay. Not sure why I’d need to be afraid of it, but she lost a pretty solid move for that. Kind of a bad tradeoff. Overall looks pretty much the same, I played vs tsubaki in the red vs blue tournament at the loketest and didn’t really see anything cool or different.

Terumi: Lol. I’m glad, it seems like they nerfed this character again. j2D isnt overhead, 6D animation is different. Fast, very short range, not a lot of whiff recovery. Goes into old animation on hit. 4D is the new overhead? Dunno if thats the right input. reactable, only super cancelable (yes). 6C sends them up into the air? Dunno what that does. But he seems less threatening on pressure tbh, lolll.

Valk: Still valk, hilariously. Wolf meter looks like it drains faster, and I think oki/confirms are a bit weaker but wolf neutral and pressure are still really strong. His standing overhead looks alright, something you can just throw out. Dunno, seems like valk but (very, very slightly) different lol. Not REALLY weaker or stronger. I’d say, slightly toned down thanks to changes in wolf meter, so passive neutral against wolf is that much more effective.

Lambda: Didnt see any :( Really wanted to see her new moves and shit! aaaaaahhh

Mu: new move is crazy!! moving the bits to attack, holy crap. looks like she can lay the pressure on super thick. Looks strong, lots of cool stuff and pressure. Didn’t get to see enough, but watching a strong mu play her and use the new move was impressive from the jump. Her pressure strings are super freeform so the hitstop reduction means her pressure is relatively hard to keep up with!

Nu: Uhhhhhhhh, backwards wheel on standing hit only staggers, new move is pretty slow and flies at a rather high arc. Definitely not the same space control as spike chaser. New j2D angle is very very steep, almost right below her. Combo rate down. Looks like she lost a lot of combo selection. Supra rage uncomboable without gravity, lost it’s startup invuln. Didn’t get to see a lot about the variants of the new moves, but as an opponent i’m very glad about the new j2D angle and backwards wheel changes lol. Definitely seems like she lost a lot. OD Super is no longer overhead (no unblockable with RC 3C) and gravity seed seems a bit different. Slower recovery perhaps?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0000593-63f10fae6fac17cab93c7260f622a787.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002462 00000000000 015166  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        City crews will replace the 75-year-old sewer under Talcott Avenue as part of a $7.6 million project.

NORWOOD PARK — A $7.6 million project to replace the sewer under Talcott Avenue is expected to snarl traffic in Norwood Park, Ald. Mary O'Connor (41st) said.

The project will replace 12-inch sewer mains with significantly larger pipes in an effort to prevent nearby homes from flooding, O'Connor said.

However, the "massive" project — scheduled to begin the first week of October — will cause street closures and traffic detours along Talcott from Neva to Ozanam avenues and along Neva Avenue from Bryn Mawr to Talcott avenues, O'Connor said.

Crews will begin working on Neva and Bryn Mawr avenues toward Talcott Avenue, and then along Talcott Avenue to Harlem Avenue. Traffic will be detoured around the construction, which is scheduled to be completed by late November, officials said.

The second stage of the project will include replacing the sewer on Talcott Avenue, and require portions of that street to be closed. It will take a year, officials said.

Parking will be restricted from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the area, officials said.

Lance Koppa said, a police spokesman. Authorities later identified the truck's driver as Natalie Butler, 37.

The pickup was hauling a flat-bed trailer carrying a purple Dodge Charger. The trailer's ramp was dragging on the ground, creating sparks and screeches.

The truck pulled into a parking lot at Highland Park Village, but then took off again toward Interstate 30 when a police cruiser arrived.

Dallas County sheriff's deputies tried to stop it at Jim Miller Road, spokesman Raul Reyna said.

Still sparking, the truck turned north onto Interstate 635, then onto the Dallas North Tollway. After it continued onto northbound Interstate 35, Farmers Branch police spiked the tires as it headed toward U.S. Highway 75.

With the tires coming off the trailer, the vehicle exited the highway and got stuck in traffic. When responding officers tried again to conduct a traffic stop, the pickup accelerated into another truck and fled north on U.S. 75.

The vehicle then exited onto the Sam Rayburn Tollway and continued to the Stacy Road exit, Reyna said.

Deputies finally apprehended Butler at Hillcrest and Lebanon roads just before 2:30 a.m. She had a bag of a substance believed to be meth, Reyna said.

Butler was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, evading arrest, accident involving damage to a vehicle and possession of a controlled substance. She was being held in the Dallas County jail Monday afternoon in lieu of $9,000 bail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0000949-9ef9a5062e836cbd0f0930fe036d1d89.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011617 00000000000 015130  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Italy has laid out plans for the creation of a “European force” that goes beyond Franco-German proposals on defence integration.

It said in an informal paper, seen by EUobserver, ahead of a defence ministers’ meeting in Bratislava on Tuesday (27 September) that the EU should create a “powerful and usable European Force that can also be employed in support to Nato or UN operations”.

Giving its full title, it said that the “joint permanent European Multinational Force (EMF)” should be created by “available member states willing to share forces, command and control, manoeuvre and enabling capabilities”.

It added that the force should be “permanently offered” to a new EU military HQ.

It also envisaged even deeper military integration in the future, saying that “the EMF will represent the initial nucleus of a future European integrated force”.

The talk of defence cooperation comes as EU leaders try to reassert the European project in the wake of Brexit.

It also comes amid growing security threats from Russia, from Middle East and north African conflicts, and from terrorist groups.

Italy did not mention Brexit, but it said that its project “would have a strong political impact, as it would express our readiness to relaunch European integration”.

It said that a “quantum leap” in EU military cooperation was needed to “avoid irrelevance”.

It also said “we face a threat both from inside and outside our societies, generating fear and uncertainty … The EU must come up with effective answers to our citizens’ growing concerns, starting with security and defence.”

Italy recognised that some member states do not want to create an EU army.

It said that its ideas would require “political vision”, a “new and more ambitious [EU] political agenda”, and “new political perspectives”.

Italian ambition

France and Germany, earlier this month, also circulated an informal paper on EU defence.

They did not call for an EU force, noting that “political responsibility for defence lies in the first place with member states”.

Like Italy, they also called for an EU military HQ, with its own medical and logistical assets, such as air-lift equipment, but they said that the HQ should command EU overseas crisis missions, not a “permanent” standing force.

Italy, France, and Germany concurred in most other areas, however.

Echoing German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke, in Vilnius earlier this month, of a “Schengen of defence”, Italy spoke of a “Union for the European Defence, pursuing a model resembling the Schengen Agreement”.

The Schengen accord, which governs the EU’s free-travel zone, was first signed by just five out of the then 10 EU member states in 1985, but later expanded to take in 22 out of 28.

Italy said EU battlegroups should be more readily deployable and EU-funded.

The ad-hoc, battalion-sized forces, made up of select EU states’ soldiers, have never seen action, in part, because capitals did not want to foot the bill.

Like France and Germany, Italy expressed interest in overseas crisis missions, in what it called “capacity to project stability in areas and regions critical to our security”, rather than in the creation of a Russia deterrent.

It said member states should invest in “ensuring a robust [military] industrial and technological base” in Europe.

It said they should do more joint procurement and EU-funded R&D and should create “a common European military education system”.

But with Rome struggling to keep its national debt within EU rules, it called for “fiscal and financial incentives” for military projects, such as “VAT exemption, support of the Investment European Bank … and facilitated loans”.

Bratislava

EU defence ministers will discuss the ideas in Bratislava, together with a Finnish paper, also seen by EUobserver, that took more notice of Russia.

Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden, have broadly endorsed the Franco-German proposals, EU sources said.

France and Germany want to move quickly, with some ideas to be implemented in 2017 or 2018.

The UK, which is likely to remain an EU member until at least 2019, and which has long-opposed EU defence integration,has threatened to veto the plans so long as it still held its seat in the EU Council.

Speaking in an interview with the Reuters news agency, published on Monday, Germany’s Von der Leyen said she had telephoned her British counterpart, Michael Fallon, after he issued the threat.

She said she told him that Berlin expected the UK “will not hinder important European Union reforms”.

"I told him the initiative is designed for a strong Europe, and that this Europe also wants to have good relations with Britain in the future, especially in the area of defence”, she said.                                                                                                                 0000901-8e7b81113225926b32ede4ddb45dc2be.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011272 00000000000 015151  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        TVDuck.com recently compiled a list of 15 facts about The Walking Dead not widely known, and popped it into this cute infographic. Take a look!

With The Walking Dead racking up some record ratings this Sunday for the midseason premiere, we got to wondering… How much do we really know about the show?

In the picture below, the TVDuck staff have put their heads together and dug up some pretty cool facts about the series which have had us shaking our heads in a mixture of disbelief and amazement.

Walkers, roamers, biters, floaters…

Well we knew that our survivors have always referred to them as walkers, and the Woodbury lot call them biters, but why not zombies? Perhaps our survivors fell the term trivialises the situation they’re in, or maybe the phrase doesn’t even exist in The Walking Dead world?

Zombie school

In this cool little snippet, we see “zombie school” in action. It’s here actors and actresses learn to be a The Walking Dead zombie. They learn how to move, what speed to move at, what noises they can make… The walkers in the series are a classical slow zombie type, rather than the 28 days infected type. For all intents and purposes they are just reanimated corpses and so will have gone through rigamortis to some extent. Creepy.

The smiling skull

In season 1, episode one, Rick is left with the blood spatter image of a smiling skull following his first kill. We checked this out for ourselves and re-watched “Days Gone By” and yep, it’s there alright. Why do you think they chose to do this?

The crossbow



Daryl Dixon is known in The Walking Dead for his signature crossbow; and it seems Norman Reedus has become equally attached. For $300 though, you can kind of understand why!

Walkers and humans don’t eat together

Well in the show it’s obvious; for walkers, humans are dinner. But it’s interesting to note that when off set the same rule applies (not that humans are dinner, but that they don’t mix!)

Zombies can’t breathe

In keeping with the notion that zombies are the undead, it makes sense that they don’t actually breathe, or need to breathe, to keep going. So when it was super cold filming for 2×13, “Beside the Dying Fire” the walkers had to have their water vapour breath digitally removed from the scene. It’s awesome what’s done to make The Walking Dead as true to form as it can be!

5000 to 1

We don’t think those odds look too great to be honest. In The Walking Dead walkers outnumber survivors 5000 to 1. And then you think about a planet of seven billion people… That’s a lot of undead wandering around hungry for some fresh flesh.

The most successful episode so far…?

Since the infographic was created, the midseason premiere for season 3, “The Suicide King” topped the previous record with 12.3 million watching; then taking the encore showings this number is more like 16.6 million. Phew…

Top zombie killers

Whilst this figure has changed since 3×09, the scores on the doors are much of a muchness. Rick is currently ranked first, with Daryl and Andrea not too far behind. Do you think this will change? Or will Rick reign supreme as zombie killing master?

Ed Jenner

The Walking Dead paid tribute to Edward Jenner, creator of the smallpox vaccine, by calling the lone scientist at the CDC (Control of Disease Center) Edwin Jenner. Edwin revealed to Rick that everyone is infected with the walker virus (presumed virus by the term “infected” although at no point does the series attempt to thoroughly explain the cause of the reanimation of the dead).

Oct. 31, 2010

This is a date no fan of The Walking Dead should ever forget. Halloween 2010 was when The Walking Dead staggered onto our screens and into our hearts. It seems so long ago now…

The bicycle walker

AMC created a series of webisodes about the unfortunate events surrounding on particular walker from season 1, episode one. You can still watch these online, too, if you’re a U.S. viewer!

SWAT

The Walking Dead caused quite the stir when Michael Rooker (a.k.a. Merle Dixon) was mistaken for a sniper and a SWAT team was called in to save the day. No one was arrested, but as you can imagine it was pretty tense!

Fish tanks and heads

There were 24 heads the Governor kept in fish tanks, and each one was yellowed using coffee, tea and dye. Grim.

Human vs. walker deaths

Up until the midseason premiere, of the 17 onscreen human deaths, 14 fatalities were caused by another human, and only three were down to walkers. I guess in the world of The Walking Dead perhaps it’s not a case of the enemies you do know, but the enemies you don’t.

What do you think of these facts? Anything particularly surprising?

Tune in to “Home,” 3×10 of The Walking Dead, this Sunday Feb. 17 on AMC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0000958-750ad1aae1452beaaef3d31620c9e75b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004635 00000000000 015313  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        in this file photo, Dr. Larry Bates, author of "The Impending Financial Collapse," speaks during a lecture at the Tennessee Tea Party Coalition inaugural convention at the Gatlinburg Convention Center in Gatlinburg, Tennessee Saturday, May 22, 2010.

Larry Bates, a former Tennessee state legislator and CEO of First American Monetary Consultants, was sentenced Tuesday to 21 years in a financial scheme that impacted more than 360 victims, including many elderly individuals.

U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman ordered Bates, 73, to pay more than $21 million in restitution to various victims impacted by the scheme, which involved buying and selling silver and gold coins.

Bates was convicted along with his two sons and a daughter-in-law in the scheme carried out through Bates' company, which had offices in Memphis and Boulder, Colorado.

"Larry Bates, a self-proclaimed doctor in economics, held conferences across the United States, predicting an economic collapse and emphasizing the need to invest in precious metals," the federal prosecutor's office said in a news release. "Between 2007 and 2013, customers gave more than eighty-seven million dollars to First American Monetary Consultants for the purpose of buying precious metals. During this same period, the proof showed the defendant diverted customers’ monies that were to be used to purchase precious metals to the defendants own use and benefit."

The prosecutor's office said Bates diverted $4 million to create a Christian radio network, International Radio Network, while other funds were used for trading commodities and building a 10,000-square-foot house in Middleton, about 80 miles east of Memphis.

By 2009, the company accumulated more than $26 million in unfilled orders from customers.

Bates, a Democrat from Martin, about 60 miles north of Jackson, previously served in the state House and represented northwest Tennessee counties from 1971 to 1976.

His son, Charles Edward Bates, was also sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and ordered to pay $19 million in restitution. The sentencing of the other son, Robert Bates, and his wife, Kinsey Bates, remained pending.

The U.S. Postal Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the case, which was prosecuted by Acting United States Attorney Lawrence J. Laurenzi and Assistant United States Attorney David Pritchard.

The popularity of the T20 tournament is staggering — and it’s growing every year — with the TAB reporting that customers are betting on average over $500,000 on every Big Bash game.

The biggest holding game so far this season was the Melbourne Renegades against the Perth Scorchers on December 30, which the Scorchers won by a massive 10 wickets at Etihad Stadium.

That match held $724,305, and that was just a regular round game — the finals don’t start for another 11 days.

Those numbers are bigger than last year’s AFL grand final, the Rugby World Cup semi-final between Argentina and the Wallabies, as well as any regular season game in the NRL or AFL. Unsurprisingly, it’s also attracted more than double what’s been placed on the recent one-sided Test series between Australia and the West Indies.

Overall, betting is up 20 per cent in the Big Bash compared to last season — a jump that’s even caught the TAB by surprise.

“Betting on the Big Bash has been building since its inception, but it has really taken off this season,” TAB’s Matt Jenkins said.

“The key drivers for its growing popularity are the fact it is on in prime time, every night and during the holidays.

“Games go for three hours, which is a huge bonus for punters who don’t have to wait all day or longer for a result.

“This summer punters and fans alike have been crying out for entertaining and competitive cricket, which they have failed to get in the Test series.

“After the Big Bash we have the ICC World Twenty20 to look forward to in March, with the Aussies $5.50 to win the tournament. India are favourites at $4.”

Tonight the Sydney Sixers host the Brisbane Heat at the SCG, with the Sixers $1.80 to win, while tomorrow night the Sydney Thunder will look to get their campaign back on track against the Melbourne Renegades. Mike Hussey’s men are $1.60 to win that one.                                                             0000854-3b438e8fd9083b13922175d05ee37574.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005176 00000000000 014630  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Ex-Liverpool defender Rigobert Song is NOT dead despite reports he had passed away from a stroke

Rigobert Song is NOT dead, despite reports that he had passed away coming out of Cameroon that he passed away this week.

The former Liverpool and West Ham defender was taken seriously ill on Sunday when he slipped into a coma in his home country.

He was taken to Yaounde Central Hospital in Cameroon after he fell unconscious. He was in a coma for two days before he was transferred to a hospital in France for further treatment.

He was seen waving at fans outside the Yaounde facility as he was taken to the airport for the journey to France.

Yaounde Emergency Centre director Dr. Louis Joss Bitang A Mafok said the 40-year-old had suffered a "cerebral hemorrhage".

Cameroon Health Minister Andre Mama Fouda told the press: "Song has departed to Pitie Salpetriere hospital in Paris, where he will continue treatment. I am grateful to the Head of State for instructing the government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Song recovers.

"We hail the professionalism of medical doctors in Cameroon and we continue to pray for a safe trip for Rigobert Song and that he should recover very fast."

On Tuesday, Dr Mafok said Song had "come out of his coma and the oxygen has been disconnected".

He added: "His high blood pressure has returned to normal and the cerebral haemorrhage has been controlled".

But on Friday, word started to spread on social media that Song had died. It appears to have been started by a report on the website African News Today, which claimed he had passed away in France after suffering a stroke.

The site even quoted his 'brother' Alex Song as saying “Our beloved passed on this morning. At this moment the family is bereaved.”

Of course, Alex Song, the former Arsenal, Barcelona and West Ham midfielder, is not Rigobert's brother, but his nephew.

No other outlet reported the news and now African sports journalist Gary Al-Smith, who has worked for the BBC and CNN among others, reported this morning that Song is NOT dead and was even able to speak.

He added:

CAF boss Issa Hayatou will be seeing Rigobert Song at La Pitié Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. Song had a cerebral aneurysm, not a stroke. — Gary = (@garyalsmith) October 8, 2016

Song had a long professional career in France, England, Germany and Turkey.

He also played 137 times for Cameroon.

All by itself, this is no great shakes: Lots of people don't believe in God, and lots of people do, and the earth spins on its path around the sun, unconcerned with what anyone standing on it thinks.

Foster's declaration is noteworthy, because Arian Foster is a football player, and Arian Foster plays football in Houston, the shiny, platter-sized rodeo buckle on America's Bible Belt. Some pundits suggest that Foster's revelation shakes the image-obsessed, traditional values foundation of the NFL. A Dallas sportswriter opines that once he returns from his groin injury, Foster will find little camaraderie in NFL locker rooms, where pre-game prayers and open expressions of faith are as common as stress fractures and oversized coolers of Gatorade. Others celebrate Foster as an important figure in American sports history, the man who will lead the way in separating our games from God.

Foster is a smart, interesting guy. Defying family traditions and culture – Foster was raised Muslim – to choose another path takes courage, and not a little self-confidence, but it doesn't make him a trailblazer. The Texans all-pro is far from the first high-profile NFL player to announce his atheism: a decade ago, Minnesota Vikings star Robert Smith told an interviewer that he did not believe in God. In a lauded 2006 Sports Illustrated profile of Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinal turned Special Forces soldier who was killed in Afghanistan, writer Gary Smith describes a young man who was intelligent and brave and principled. And atheist.

It seems unlikely that one reasonably successful halfback on a team whose performance is best described as "middling" is going to single-handedly lead the Youth of America into the clutches of humanism, any more than Tim Tebow's public displays of faith sparked a great evangelical revival. Foster, like Tebow, believes what he believes, and those who are sympathetic to his views will hail him. Those who aren't, won't. Heroes are a lot like breakfast cereal, or toothpaste: We like what we like, and we pretty much stick with it.

And what we like generally begins and ends on the playing field. In the '90s, lot of Houston little leaguers mimicked the strange, bow-legged batting stance of Jeff Bagwell, or the banty rooster strut of Craig Biggio. In the '70s, every running back in the state wore a tear-away jersey, just like Earl Campbell. I don't know if any of those aspiring superstars ever considered a conversion to Roman Catholicism, to be like Biggio, or considered going into the hot links business, a la Mr. Campbell. There are apocryphal stories that at the turn of the last century, young boys across the country were lopping off the pointer and pinkie on their pitching hands, in emulation of Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown, the farm machine accident victim turned greatest curveballer in the world, who was leading the Chicago Cubs to two consecutive World Series victories, but I don't know that the youth of today possess that level of commitment.

What makes Foster's announcement interesting is that he has put himself forth as an evangelist for his beliefs. Many football players, among them Smith and Tillman and former NFLer Chris Kluwe, have been honest about their disbelief, but marshaling others to the cause was not part of the package. Foster sees himself as a rallying point for the unbeliever, Christopher Hitchens in hip pads. This could alienate a lot of people, the same way public prayers in end zones do. There are remarkable similarities between the religious zealot and the unbeliever, the Tebow and the anti-Tebow: both claim to know the unknowable, both insist that they walk the one true path, and most of the time, both respond to dissenting voices with some degree of viciousness. Whether it's Bill Maher nastiness or Bible-thumping consignments to hell, it's unpleasant stuff. Is the NFL ready for a secular humanist missionary?

Short of burning Bibles as part of his touchdown celebration, what Arian Foster believes, or doesn't believe, isn't going to matter much, so long as he's producing. An NFL scout once told a radio audience that the only thing he cares about is, "Can the guy play?" "If Jeffrey Dahmer could run a 4.4 forty," he continued, "we would have written the cannibalism thing off as an 'eating disorder.'" As Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to make an NFL training camp, learned, being an icon doesn't matter, if you aren't good enough to play.

Even when we know their frailties, heroes, especially sports heroes, exist outside of reality, mythologized, idealized, their reality defined only by their prowess and their image. Billy Crystal grew up idolizing Mickey Mantle, and even after he came to know Mantle the man, a boozy, womanizing boor, Crystal's view of Mantle the hero was undimmed. I grew up with a huge poster of O.J. Simpson on my bedroom wall, and though I know better, there's a tiny part of me still suspects that Juice is an innocent man, that someone who ran so beautifully couldn't do something so evil. Surely there are some Texans fans out there who are aghast at the thought of rooting for an atheist. If Foster, once healthy, leads the club to the Super Bowl, they'll feel differently: He could be an atheist, a Presbyterian, or a Druid, and no one will care. Principles don't matter in the NFL; results do. A Chronicle sports columnist this week advocated for the Texans signing Ray Rice, the disgraced, girlfriend-beating running back, because, let's be honest, we need him, and that's more important that any self-righteous moral stance about not employing women abusers. Just win, baby.

Four decades ago, Terry Allen lampooned football's false piety in "The Great Joe Bob (a regional tragedy)". Star running back Joe Bob is the "pride of the backfield, the hero of his day...and there ain't nothin' as American or clean." Things go awry. Joe Bob loses his Texas Tech scholarship. He cavorts with loose women, and robs a liquor store. Worse, "he growed his hair and he give up prayer." "No one could understand it," Allen laments, "they just couldn't comprehend it, when the Great Joe Bob went bad." More recently, Ben Fountain's brilliant Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk features a swirling, surreal Thanksgiving halftime show, fireworks and PTSD-suffering Afghan War heroes and booze and beefy rich guys squeezed into expensive Officially Licensed Team Gear, footballs and noise and Destiny's Child, all crammed under the gape-roofed decadence of Texas Stadium. Football is spectacle, nothing more, something loud and shiny to make us feel part of something, even as it parts us from our hard-earned cash. It's Las Vegas in shoulder pads, Gladiator in cleats. If one of the helmeted Hessians on the field is an atheist, so be it. So long as the beer keeps flowing and the home team wins, it doesn't really matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0000951-54fb6ed7fab067d26c429000e6fd91e3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003157 00000000000 015171  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Muay Thai with its strong youth appeal, receives provisional recognition as Olympic sport by the International Olympic Committee on Tuesday, December 6, 2016 in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The provisional recognition is a first step on a long road to becoming a future Olympic sport. Such recognition is given for a period of three years. During that time, the IOC executive board can recommend full recognition.

Muay Thai will receive $25,000 in annual funding from IOC. It can also take part in numerous programmes, that includes athlete development and anti-doping.

Together with Muay Thai, the Competitive Cheerleading is also provisionally recognized by the IOC. They take the number of recognized Olympic sports to 37.

“Muaythai is an organisation with 135 national federations, nearly 60 are recognized by their national Olympic Committees and nearly 400,000 registered athletes,” said IOC Sports Director Kit McConnell.

“The international cheer union [ICU] has over 100 national federations and nearly 4.5 million registered athletes.”

“It is a sport with growing popularity, a strong youth focus in schools and universities and we noted that,” he added.

Muay Thai and Cheerleading were among 16 sports bodies that applied for IOC recognition earlier this year.

“The door has not been shut for the other applicants,” McConnell said.

“We will continue to look at the other applications we received.”

Becoming part of the Olympic Games is a seven-year progress

Tokyo accommodates the 2020 Games. According to the new rules, the host cities can introduce sports of their choice for a one-off appearance in the Games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0000934-1b06a45a2e7f9907ddc0b60825f8f013.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004271 00000000000 015021  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Any time I get to be superefficient and combine two of my favorite pastimes, I get really excited. I recently got to do just that at a cat yoga class. Yes, cat yoga. It's a yoga class at a cat cafe where cats are roaming around asking for pets and belly rubs.

Can you imagine anything better than that for us cat ladies?

New York's Meow Parlour opened recently as a place where cat-lovers can come and hang out with adoptable cats for a small fee. The owners then decided to add a yoga class right in the middle of the place, surrounded by cats. The class time starts with 30 minutes of cat playtime, followed by 45 minutes of yoga, and finished with 15 more minutes of cat playtime to cool down.

Going in, I had a lot of thoughts and feelings. Cats! And yoga! And more cats! All in the same place! And cat-shaped cookies at the patisserie around the corner! I kept telling everyone who would listen that I was going to cat yoga and it was going to be the greatest day of my life. But personally, I can't be in the vicinity of a cat and not try to pet it. So I feared I would spend the whole class distracted by the fur balls walking around me and purring in my face.

But class didn't end up being like that at all. I arrived and spent time petting a group of really mellow cats before class. We had a real yoga instructor, and real yoga mats, and a real yoga practice. (For some reason I felt like because it was cat yoga, it wouldn't be a fully beneficial yoga class.) For the most part, the cats all ran and hid for the majority of the class time. There was one little guy curled up in a hut sleeping beside my mat. I managed to contain myself and only scratched behind his ears one time during class.

The class is small and peaceful and actually really great. I wasn't distracted by the cats at all, but maybe that was because they were too busy sleeping. If you're a cat-lover in New York who is always looking for cat-related activities to fill your time (I just described myself in a nutshell), I highly recommend checking out Meow Parlour's yoga class. If you're not in New York, then I highly recommend wrangling your cat at home and making him join you for yoga. It's bound to be a blast no matter what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0000991-9b352695d88f40531a8d8495f8b9cf76.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003141 00000000000 014732  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Zambia will not arrest former US president George W. Bush during his African tour for violating international torture laws, the foreign minister said Saturday.

Rights group Amnesty International had Thursday urged Ethiopia, Tanzania and Zambia to arrest Bush during the five-day tour to promote efforts to fight diseases like cancer, AIDS and malaria.

"On what basis does Amnesty International want us to arrest Mr Bush? Tell them to hang, and also please ask them to create their own country and wait for Mr Bush to visit their country so that they can arrest him to suit their wish and not here in Zambia," Foreign Minister Chishimba Kambwili told AFP.

Bush is in Zambia on the second stop of the tour, having arrived in Tanzania on Thursday.

Kambwili said Zambia would only arrest Bush if the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other international organisations such as the United Nations asked the southern African country's government to do so.

Amnesty made a similar appeal to Canada in October when Bush visited British Columbia for an economic summit.

The group argued that Bush authorised the use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" and "waterboarding" on detainees held in secret by the Central Intelligence Agency between 2002 and 2009.

Amnesty's case relies on the public record, US documents accessed through freedom of information requests, Bush's own memoir and a Red Cross report critical of the United States' war on terror policies.

The group cites several instances of alleged torture of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval facility, in Afghanistan and in Iraq by the US military. - ANP/AFP
